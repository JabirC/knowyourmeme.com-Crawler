<!-- 
Planned Classes 

knowyourmeme.com has more than just memes... 
There are:
Cultures
Events
Memes
People
Sites
Subcultures

The URL structure is always: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/abc/xyz
Where:
abc is one of the categories
xyz is a specific instance of said category

As such, I plan on creating classes for each of these categories.
The data population will be exactly the same, but there will be some parent class: Category (will have to resolve name with the Category class already here).

  <textRepresentation>ew Bring Back National Dex refers to the backlash following the announcement that the 2019 video games Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield will not include the full roster of Pokmon from previous games and only include Pokmon that appear in the Galar Pokdex This is the first game in the series that will not allow for some Pokmon from previous generations of Pokmon titles The backlash also occurred within the Japanese arm of the fandom where it spread on Twitter and Pixiv under the hashtag  compatibility cut Background On June 11th 2019 during the Nintendo Treehouse showcase at Nintendos E3 event there was a showcase for the Pokmon Sword and Shield on the game floor During the end of the showcase Pokmon director Junichi Masuda announced in advance that in Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield players will only be able to transfer Pokmon from the Pokmon Home app if they appear within the Galar region Pokdex thereby removing the possibility for certain monsters to be playable at all The reason for this move has been attributed to a number of issues such as efforts to balance the games roster and reducing the number of character models within the game data to make for higher quality animations Masuda also appeared to state that this would be the policy for all future games in the series4 Speaking to USGamer5 Masuda said We knew at some point we werent going to be able to indefinitely keep supporting all of the Pokemon We just found that Sword and Shield would probably be a good point to go back and reevaluate what would be the best selection of Pokemon that appeal to the widest audience while keeping into consideration the balance of the battle system It isnt just going to be allnew Pokemon in the Galar region Pokedex theres still going to be a lot of favorites that fans will be able to bring over that theyve adventured with previously But yeah it was pretty much just balancing and getting this optimal selection of Pokemon for the adventure we wanted to provide Developments Following the announcement fans were quick to voice their disapproval for not being able to transfer their Pokmon to the latest entries Twitter users started the BringBackNationalDex hashtag amounting over seven thousands tweets in a day1 Part of the disapproval stemmed from doubt in Masudas explanation for why the Pokmon were cut Twitter user shofu tweeted a sarcastic example of the games animation being high quality gaining over 5900 retweets and 21000 likes shown below User ExoExplorer tweeted a similar joke gaining over 1200 retweets and 3000 likes shown below right Junichi Masuda reaffirms that the sheer volume of high quality animations and desire to balance further resulted in the decision to block transfer of some Pokmon This is some high quality animation alright pictwittercomgwXJCrXLqD Garbage shofu June 12 2019 Yeah I just found this clip The animation on those wingull is really something I feel completely comforted knowing we had to sacrifice the national dex for this step up in quality BringBackNationalDex PokemonE3 pictwittercomd4tGVdBnbG ExoExplorer ExoExplorer June 12 2019 Others created memes decrying the change Twitter user extendedfreeze2 tweeted an object labeling meme about the change gaining over 280 retweets and 740 likes shown below left User Roeltje6663 also posted an object labeling meme about the change gaining 7 retweets and 30 likes shown below right The controversy was covered by multiple gaming outlets including Polygon who defended the decision against criticism3 writing Many miffed players are calling Game Freak lazy for not bringing the entire compendium of 800 monsters into Sword and Shield which is a wild thing to say The problem isnt laziness The problem if you can call it that is a difference in priorities If Game Freak thought it was important to have the entire Pokdex available in the Galar region it would do exactly that Instead the developer seems to be putting its focus on other portions of the game We know that Sword and Shield will have raids an open world extended online capabilities and a 3D camera all in addition to improved graphics Gamesradar4 also covered the criticism understanding that while it would surely be difficult to model 800 Pokmon into future Pokmon titles If your favourite Pokemon isnt chosen for Sword and Shield well tough luck Theres seemingly very little we can do about it If you dont get lucky with the next games Pokemon Catapult and Trebuchet anyone either your Pokemon will simply be stuck in Pokemon Home limbo unable to progress any further Masudas Message On June 28th 2019 the official Pokmon twitter made an announcement a message for Pokmon video game fans The link sent users to the official Pokmon page with a statement from Junichi Masuda Thank you to all of our fans for caring so deeply about Pokmon Recently I shared the news that some Pokmon cannot be transferred to Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield Ive read all your comments and appreciate your love and passion for Pokmon Just like all of you we are passionate about Pokmon and each and every one of them is very important to us After so many years of developing the Pokmon video games this was a very difficult decision for me Id like to make one thing clear even if a specific Pokmon is not available in Pokmon Sword and Pokmon Shield that does not mean it will not appear in future games The world of Pokmon continues to evolve The Galar region offers new Pokmon to encounter Trainers to battle and adventures to embark on We are pouring our hearts into these games and we hope you will look forward to joining us on this new journey June 28 2019 Junichi Masuda After the message fans were quick to call out the statement for the lack of any promises for the newer entries in the series who were hoping for future patches While other were angered that Masuda made a response to the backlash Search Interest Know Your Meme Store External

Pokmon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team DX a Switch remake of the 2006 Pokmon Mystery Dungeon Rescue Team games and expansion packs for Pokmon Sword and Shield titled The Isle of Armor and The Crown Tundra The expansion passes will expand to new areas outside the Galar region and players will be able to enter the areas using their current save file Both areas will have areas that operate similar to the Wild Area in the base game In the Direct Game Freak clarified that these expansions will take the place of the traditional altered versions of the base game like Pokmon Platinum Pokmon Ultra Sun and Moon and Pokmon Black and White 2 The Direct also teased that both old and new legendary Pokmon would be available in the expansions as would several preexisting Pokmon that were not present in the base game such as Garchomp Blastoise Venusaur and many others The Direct stated that there will be roughly 200 old Pokmon in total entering the game through the Expansion Pass14 Certain Pokmon and

2020 and The Crown Tundra will release in Fall of 2020 They are available for prepurchase for 2999 Reception The game received intense backlash prior to its release due to what fans perceived as poor quality in leaked footage and data about the game These issues largely stemmed from the cutting of 400 Pokmon from the National Pokdex making Sword and Shield the first games in the series to not include every Pokmon in the series history Game Freak had stated that they had made this choice in order to create higher quality animations for the existing Pokmon in the game When footage of the game leaked however fans did not accept Game Freaks excuse claiming that the animations were not significantly improved enough from previous titles to justify the cut Pokmon Several moves that had appeared in previous games were also cut from the games including moves popular in the competitive Pokmon scene like Return and Frustration These frustrations were covered in hashtags BringBackNationalDex and GameFreakLied Critical Reception Though fans had generated significant backlash to the games prior to their release critics were mostly positive about Sword and Shield On the day of the games release the games Metacritic score was 81 or generally favorable11 Some critics called them the best Pokmon games in years Gamespot12 wrote the game cut down on the tedious and protracted elements from previous games in favor of amplifying what makes Pokemon great in the first place In the least positive review included in Metacritics score the Daily Star gave the game a 3513 writing that Dynamaxing was a shallow imitation of past games features and that the Wild Area the games new wildPokmon feature was akin to a levelgated Safari Zone Critic Dom Peppiatt concluded that the game could be thought of as a goodnotgreat Pokmon game Online Presence BringBackNationalDex Bring Back National Dex refers to the backlash towards the reveal that Pokmon Sword and Shield will not allow players to transfer Pokmon absent from the Galar Regional Pokdex breaking the seriess tradition of having all Pokmon from past generations usable in one title even if they are not able to be caught ingame Following this restrictions reveal at Nintendo Treehouses E3 2019 presentation fans voiced their displeasure towards it over various social media outlets and the aforementioned presentation became the most disliked video of E3 201910 ThankYouGameFreak ThankYouGameFreak is a hashtag started by a Pokmon fan intended to celebrate and appreciate Pokmon developers Game Freak amid ongoing criticisms and controversy for the asyet unreleased Pokmon Sword and Shield Many fans used the hashtag as intended while others used it more sarcastically to further criticize Game Freak A

of spineless cowards who would rather lick your boot than have any form of self respect GameFreakLied GameFreakLied is a hashtag used to complain about Pokmon Sword and Shield after an apparent datamine of the asyetunreleased games appeared to confirm that Pokmon developers Game Freak had reused character models and animations from previous entries in the series The company had previously taken the position that it was forced to cut a significant amount of Pokmon because it was remaking animations and character models from scratch The decision colloquially known as Dexit was unpopular with fans and upon seeing that Game Freaks excuse did not seem legitimate fans tweeted angrily about the upcoming games using leaked footage On November 12th 2019 Redditor MindWeb125 posted a thread in rpokemon showing allegedly leaked datamined comparisons of several Sword and Shield Pokmon models and the same Pokmon models from the previous games Pokmon Sun and Moon This was significant as Game Freaks Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori had previously stated that the reason many Pokmon from previous entries were cut in Sword and Shield was so the team could focus on remaking Pokmon from scratch Meanwhile the leaks were posted to Twitter by user BlazingFlare two posted GIFs comparing models gaining over 160 retweets and 440 likes shown below Ive been going through the returning

reads Ok guys i feel like we need to formulate a game plan Ive put together this easy to follow diagram here for a proposed plan The basic idea is that the Kyles form the front line if we feed them enough psilocybin and monster energy and say that anyone in camouflage is their step dad and the entire base is made of drywall then they will go berserk and become an impenetrable wall Then the Rock Throwers will throw pebbles at the inevitable resistance we dont want to hurt them we just want to annoy them enough to not shoot the Kyles as often While this is all happening the two Naruto runner battalions will run full speed around the north and south flank and shadow clone jutsu effectively tripling our numbers and overwhelm the base red circle PS Hello US government this is a joke and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet Im not responsible if people decide to actually storm area 51 During the

  <textRepresentation>ew Etika Suicide refers to the death161718 of famous YouTuber Desmond Amofah otherwise known as Etika After months of making posts which alarmed onlookers about his mental health he posted a video on June 20th 2019 which saw him walking in New York City and apologizing to multiple people hes harmed or wronged and saying he would not live to see the release of games and media To viewers the video seemed like a suicide note Concerns were further raised when the NYPD tweeted looking for tips in finding Etika1 who had not been heard from since 800 PM the day before the video was uploaded Local news also ran reports about his disappearance1920 The NYPD confirmed that he was dead on June 25th 201913 Background Etika has scared fans about his mental health by alluding to suicide and and giving megalomaniacal statements since October of 2018 Over the course of the following several months he had several incidents where he tweeted about killing himself and at one point livestreamed the police arriving at his house and arresting him for his safety The following day he compared himself to the Antichrist in an interview with Keemstar On May 1st 2019 he was filmed fighting an NYPD officer On June 19th 2019 Etika posted a video to YouTube apologizing to his fans saying he was sorry for betraying their trust and pushing them away He stated he was not suicidal in previous incidents saying in an attempt to be edgy I fucked up my entire life It also featured Etika talking as though he would not be alive for much longer saying things like there will be games movies technology Ill never see Ill never see Attack on Titan He also said the world will be better off without me To many it appeared like a suicide note The video was deleted from YouTube reupload shown below Developments Initially people were divided on the legitimacy of Etikas condition as some of his previous scares had been considered hoaxes or him being edgy which he alludes to in the video This was compounded by the fact that on June 2nd Etika tweeted asking When should I have my next mental breakdown yall what days yall niggas got off  User absolutemystic suggested June 20th as most people will be out of school to which Etika replied Ill put this on my calendar shown below This led some like Keemstar to believe Etikas June 19th video was staged and insincere Others including 3andrewsinarow argued that the exchange could be interpreted as Etika secretly asking his fans for a date on which to kill himself and then receiving one On June 20th the NYPD posted a tweet saying Etika was missing and asking for tips1 The tweet gained over 23000 retweets and 36000 likes shown below Fox New York ran a news story about his disappearance2 as did more global publications like

  <textRepresentation>AntMan Will Defeat Thanos by Crawling Up His Butt and Expanding also known as the Thanus Theory refers to a humorous fan theory speculating that in the 2019 Marvel superhero film Avengers Endgame the character AntMan will defeat Thanos by entering the villains body through the anus while in his microscopic form and rapidly expand from the inside killing Thanos in the process In March 2019 the theory spawned a series of related memes on Reddit Origin Prior to the release of 2018 film Avengers The Infinity War several users online proposed various theories on how Avengers could defeat supervillain Thanos some of which relied on AntMans ability to shrink to minuscule size and expand back For example on July 29th 2017 Redditor sodabased suggested that Avengers could put Hulk in the AntMans suit get him inside Thanoss mouth and let him expand back once he reaches the supervillians urethra1 On December 10th 2017 Redditor iwasherenotyou suggested that AntMan himself could enter Thanos body and expand2 On December 19th 2017 Redditor maxwellthebeech posted a mockup poster of AntMan climbing Thanoss ear in rMarvel subreddit where it gained over 1300 upvotes In the comments several Reddit users speculated on the idea of AntMan killing Thanos by expanding from inside his body with Redditor Rayhann suggesting that AntMan could crawl up his ass and deeply violate his very being which would traumatize him3 Months later on March 16th 2018 Redditor16 bigblackhotdog posted in the rmarvelstudios subreddit If antman gets small goes into thanos b hole and then grows big would thanos grow with him or explode in ecstacy Spread On March 19th 2018 Tumblr 15 user tanjonathans wrote infinity war is a dumb movie cause why would you bother all those heroes to fight thanos when all you have to do is get antman inside his asshole make him grow back to his normal size and thats it purple joss whedon is dead The post received more than 139000 notes in one year shown below On April 30th 2018 Twitter4 user filmgloss speculated on a potential reason why AntMan did not appear in recently released Avengers Infinity War making a reference to the humorous theory The post gained over 11000 retweets and 30400 likes in one year On May 1st 2018 Tumblr user astew posted a screenshot of the tweet which gained over 83200 likes and reblogs in the same period5 In the following months the possibility of the theory working was discussed on Reddit and other online platforms6 On June 7th 2018 YouTuber John Campea posted an analysis of the theory shown below left7 On July 20th YouTube channel entertainmentie released a video interview with the AntMan actor Paul Rudd in which they asked the actor about the theory shown below right I almost think its a question for Thanos If there is one thing we learned from Infinity War it is that Thanos can take a lot of punishment And so you know On March 14th 2019 Redditor Aimless_Devastator commented Are we still betting on Antman defeating Thanos by crawling up his butt then expanding in rmovies thread dedicated to an Avengers Endgame trailer In the thread Redditor Nolio1212 posted a response which gained over 15200 upvotes in six days quoted below8 I thought about this and I cant think of a worse death for Antman Thanos is pretty tough like can take some punches from the Hulk kindoftough well his butthole and insides have to be hulklevel strong too The way I see it happening is Antman crawling up his butt expanding and then whatever I can describe as the chunky human soup that would come flying out of Thanos ass from Antman trying to expand into something that just wont budge On the same day Redditor x720xHARDSCOPEx posted the comment in rcopypasta subreddit gaining over 8200 upvotes in six days9 On March 15th 2019 Redditor KushPatil made a post referencing the theory in rprequelmemes subreddit which received over 50800 upvotes in five days10 In March 2019 numerous notable posts referencing the theory appeared in rdankmemes1112 subreddit Josh Brolins Response On March 28th 2019 Thanos actor Josh Brolin posted an old video of exerting himself on a toilet bowl13 hashtagged flushanantman as a reference to the theory The video gained over 12 million views and 280000 likes in 24 hours The original video was first posted by Brolin on April 21st 201814 View this post on Instagram The tension

Brolina joshbrolin on Mar 28 2019 at 349pm PDT Scientific Explanation On April 2nd 2019 Mel Magazine17 published A BIOPHYSICIST EXPLAINS HOW ANTMAN COULD KILL THANOS FROM INSIDE HIS ASS In the article the author writes the various results of what could happen if AntMan performed the theory Alex Klotz from MIT said If AntMan were more fluid as he expanded he would splurt through the two sphincters on either side of the rectum out of the anus and into the colon However based on videos of him shrinking and growing it looks like he can only expand isotropically without changing shape I can think of three possibilities he just gets stuck rectumsized until he shrinks again he tries to expend but builds up so much pressure that it kills him Antman splurts out of the anus Ultimately he concludes that because of both Thanos strength and the power of the Power Stone Thanos body may be more resilient than normal Therefore AntMan might not burst through Thanos entire body Klotz says Each tissue and connection in the body has its own strength and its own limits so even if he can expand through the rectal wall I dont know if for example the same could be said about breaking the pelvis So AntMan may burst through the anus but possibly not the entirety of Thanos body Literally tearing him a new one will do plenty of damage in its own right and at the very least itll be extremely unpleasant Chuck Tingle Adaptation On April 10th 2019 erotica novelist Chuck Tingle released an erotic adaptation of the theory entitled Revengers Buttgame Antguy Gets Small To Go Into Thamos Butt And Then Gets Big And Hard18 That day the author tweeted19 please enjoy new tingler superhero event REVENGERS BUTTGAME ANTGUY GETS SMALL TO GO INTO THAMOS BUTT AND THEN GETS BIG AND HARD out now The post

Fallout 76 The teaser gained over 17 million views in a matter of hours shown below At E3 2018 Todd Howard revealed more details about the game calling it a softcore survival game that will be played entirely online and a prequel to the Fallout narrative He also discussed the game being available in an open beta starting October 23rd 2018 and confirmed a November 14th 2018 release date1 GameDeleting Bug On October 30th 2018 Bethesda tweeted PC Fallout76 BETA players We are aware of an issue with the client and are investigating Do not click any buttons on the client for the time being1 The issue in question turned out to be that clicking any button on the launch client led to the entire 50GB game being deleted and launching a redownload The issue was mocked online as the worst bug a Bethesda game has ever had and the company has been notorious for bugs in the past User dnannann mocked the bug and Bethesdas history in a tweet that gained over 4700 retweets and 10000 likes shown below left User 9_volt_ also made a joke that gained over 1200 retweets and 5000 likes shown below right Release Fallout 76 was released November 14th 2018 Initial reaction to the release was mostly negative Critics were unable to review the game before it came out and the user score on Metacritic has wavered between 25 and 30 on the first day of release4 though Forbes5 warned this could be an example of reviewbombing saying Review bombing is fairly standard operating procedure for developers that anger the hivemind in one way or another in this case committing the sin of taking an established property in a new direction Kotaku writer Ethan Gachs first impression of the game detailed frustrating situations and unresponsive controls6 In a Reddit post on rOutofTheLoop7 user turcois asked about the hate for the game to which user lorddrame responded with an extensive list of problems with the game including  Bethesda has gone the anticonsumer route by selling an incomplete product bugs and selling the beta as a demo  it is buggy the engine clearly isnt made well for it The FOV is locked to a level that can cause litteral if minor health issues for some people and the FPS is locked as the speed of some parts are tied to FPS which is almost a cardinal sin in modern game production  The difficulty is so low that cooperation is discouraged The world is very empty little to do really outside grinding mobs that die incredibly fast and collecting loot The quests are cookiecutter types we have seen a million times before As of November 20th the game has a critic score of 51100 on Metacritic4 Additionally pictures of a physical copy of the game released with the 200 power armor special edition of Fallout 76 revealed that the physical copy inside the games box was a cardboard disc with a download code on it8 The circulating pictures led to criticism of Bethesda as selling something the player explicitly did not order on v9 and Tumblr10 Nuke Crash In Fallout 76 nuking a locale causes higherlevel enemies to spawn and better loot to drop11 On November 17th 2018 YouTuber Nickaroo93 organized the launch of three nukes at once Shortly after the nukes go off he is booted from the server His video documenting the event gained over 693000 views shown below The video was widely covered by gaming and tech news sites including The Verge11 PC Gamer12 Techspot13 and others Gamestop Tantrum On November 17th 2018 Facebook user Tarenthis Campbell posted a video of a Gamestop customer attempting to return Fallout 76 When the man behind the desk

on the platform YouTube reupload shown below The video was covered by Daily Dot14 who praised the man behind the counter for keeping a calm demeanor during the outburst The video was also posted to Twitter by user GeoffLife where it gained over 18000 retweets A reply by CNJcast praising the cashier gained over 1000 likes shown below Denial of Refunds On November 27th 2018 OneAngryGamer15 reported that after the viral Gamestop tantrum other players reported that they couldnt receive refunds for Fallout 76 in no matter how or where they purchased it from and that a law firm Migliaccio  Rathod LLP was investigating Bethesda Game Studios for deceptive trade practices In an update on their website16 the law firm wrote Migliaccio  Rathod LLP is currently investigating Bethesda Game Studios for releasing a heavilyglitched game Fallout 76 and refusing to issue refunds for PC purchasers of the game who found it to be unplayable because of its technical problems While minor bugs and glitches are expected with the release of most new games Fallout 76 launched with a 56GB patch that has proven to be but a starting point for the games problems Gamers who have tried to receive a refund because of the games myriad glitches have been unable to do so since they downloaded the game leaving them to deal with an unplayable experience until patches bring it back to a playable state That update was also posted to rpcgaming17 where it gained over 8600 points before being deleted for due to violating the subreddits rules against selfpromotion The law firm was later interviewed by Vice18 There they reported that theyd received over 200 calls from players who were unable to obtain a refund from Bethesda Nylon Bag On November 28th 2018 customers who purchased the 200 Fallout 76 Collectors Edition expressed their disappointment as they received a nylon bag with their purchase instead of the advertised higherquality canvas bag20 The backlash started spreading after user AllGamesDelta_19 posted about the issue including a response from Bethesda which stated The bag shown in the media was a prototype and was too expensive to make We arent planning on doing anything about it The Fallout Twitter account responded to the user saying the customer service employee was a temp and not directly employed by Bethesda The account also issued an apology providing a way for players who felt cheated by the collectors addition to receive 500 atoms YouTuber YongYea posted a video response to the controversy gaining over 330000 views in less than 24 hours Private Information Leak On December 5th Redditor Jessiepie21 posted to rfo76 telling players he had access to their private information and the ability to edit it writing I am receiving every single one of your support tickets on my Bethesda account Mostly its your receipts for you power armor set requesting a new bag These receipts contain all your info Your email and home address and the card you used to buy this

  <textRepresentation>Big Chungus refers to an image of the cartoon character Bugs Bunny usually captioned with the phrase Big Chungus and presented as a game for PlayStation 4 console The word chungus was coined by video game journalist Jim Sterling several years before the meme became popular Origin Fat Bugs Bunny The image of Bugs Bunny appears in Merrie Melodies cartoon Wabbit Twouble first shown on December 20th 19411 In the short Bugs is mocking Elmer Fudd who in this cartoon was made much more portly than his previous and more iconic design clip shown below On May 27th 2017 an anonymous 4chan2 user posted the image of obese Bugs Bunny to lit board shown below upper left The next appearance of the image on 4chan can be tracked to July 19th 20173 shown below upper right with more posts containing it appearing on lit and other boards later that year45 On July 21st 2017 Redditor6 hollerbravo uploaded a screencap of 4chan thread containing the image to r4Chan subreddit On July 27th 2017 a captioned image of obese Bugs Bunny was posted7 by Eclectic Memes Facebook group The post has since been deleted with copies scraped by Meme8 and Onsizzle9 Chungus The word chungus was allegedly coined by English freelance video game journalist Jim Sterling who would often use it in various meanings without a set definition10 The exact date when the word was first used is currently unknown but is estimated to be prior to December 2012 On December 26th 2012 Urban Dictionary11 user Whidmark submitted an entry for Chungus defining it as a word meaning anything and everything including but not limited to a chunky anus On August 8th 2016 in a Reddit thread exploring the origin of Chungus Redditor12 ASuitofT51PowerArmor posted his own description of Chungus based on Sovereigns speech13 from Mass Effect videogame The comment would later resurge as a copypasta in December 2018 Chungus has no beginning Chungus has no end Chungus is infinite Millions of years after our civilization has been eradicated and forgotten Chungus will endure Chungus is eternal The pinnacle of evolution and existence We are but rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh We touch Chungus mind fumbling in ignorance incapable of understanding Organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation an accident Our lives are measured in years and decades We wither and die Chungus is eternal Before it we are nothing Chungus imposes order on the chaos of organic life We exist because Chungus allows it and we will end because Chungus demands it Chungus transcends our very understanding We cannot grasp the nature of Chungus existence Big Chungus The very first instance of a meme containing the caption Big Chungus was posted by an unknown iFunny account on November 27th 2016 and contained an image of a Second Life life character bearing the nickname shown below left27 On March 20th 2018 the image of fat Bugs Bunny was first paired with the phrase by Redditor GaryTheTaco but was not been made public until it was posted to rcomedyheaven on December 1st 2018 shown below right14 In a rOutOfTheLoop thread launched by Redditor PunkyFickle on December 19th GaryTheTaco claimed authorship of the image15 providing further proof in a post to rBigChungus subreddit16 The true story behind Big Chungus is back in March I made the meme to send to a friend when Inwas bored in class he didnt think much of it Over the summer I sent it to another friend he thought it was hilarious so I made Big Chungus 2 then 3 and so on Then I just sort of forgot about it until 2 weeks ago when I thought Hey lets post it to rcomedyheaven It got some traction there but the real traction came a week later when my friend sent me a post from Facebook of a kid who asked his mom for Big Chungus That was later reposted and got 10x the karma as the original Big Chungus the OP of that DMd me saying he was a meme thief TLDR its just a fat Bugs Bunny PS4 game that got popular because a clueless mom asked a Gamestop employee if they had it in stock like the Battletoads trend Spread On September 16th 2018 rBigChungus17 subreddit was created by Redditor youarepepemangay however the subreddit did not share any connection with the meme until it gained popularity in December 2018 On December 7th 2018 GameStop store manager Justin Laufer made a Facebook18 post sharing a story of a customer who wanted to purchase a game named Big Chungus for PlayStation 4 On the next day Twitter19 user fluffypkmn shared a screenshot of Laufers post The tweet went viral gathering more than 13800 retweets within a twoweek period On December 10th 2018 Redditor20 j_dot21 reposted a meme originally created by urepublicof_Taiwan21 mentioning the word chungus to rme_irl subreddit shown below left The post gained more than 7900 upvotes over a 10day period On December 13th 2018 Redditor22 namffauk uploaded one of the screenshots posted by fluffypkmn to rcomedyheaven subreddit where it gained 13100 upvotes within a week show below right Between December 12th and 17th the creator of the original image posted Big Chungus sequels to rcomedyheaven subreddit shown below The meme subsequently rose to popularity in rdankmemes rsbubby and other subreddits with users posting new variations of the Bugs Bunny image and editing it into covers of popular video games Karen Chungus On January 5th 2019 Redditor turtlenometry submitted a screenshot of a Facebook page for Karen Chungus to the rBigChungus23 subreddit shown below left The profile was widely circulated along with references to the Big Chungus and Karen memes along with jokes about the antivaccination movement On January 7th Redditor Internal_Blaze submitted a Mafia Citythemed image macro comparing Big Chungus

Mr Cool ICE pictures is unknown several early posts of the photographs link to a sincedeleted interview with Steinberger on the German website Starblind However the earliest known post of the photographs of Steinberger shirtless and flexing was posted on the website BME on August 28th 2005 shown below1 Spread Over the next decade the images of Mr Cool ICE were shared on various message boards including Democratic Underground2 pocketfives3 Something Awful 4 and more On May 17th 2007 pocketfives3 user vdog explained Mr Cool Ices background They wrote His hometown is Mainz he is 33 years old and has gone by Mr Cool Ice for the last 13 years He basically states thats just who he is period They do a tour of his apartment and we discover that he is a clean freak Everything has to be spotless and in the right place The 2 girls on the talk show are basically making an ass out of him and a direct translation from the girl sitting closest to him is You look like Shit He has spent over 4000 euros to get his tattoos which is about 6 000 USD On September 14th 2008 YouTuber iancities posted a video of the Mr Cool Ice photographs set to the music of the Jonas Brothers The post received more than 42000 views in ten years shown below left Two years later September 24th 2010 Sensor Magazine6 published an interview with Mr Cool Ice regarding his daily routine and lifestyle The

Geissen Show a German daytime talkshow The post received more than 63000 views in seven years On June 6th 2018 Redditor 5 Somf_machine posted an English translation of the interview They wrote Mr Ice I made up the name myself so its mine patentregistered on me mmmh so I basically started here  by myself Frank wasnt there  to design the skull cut The logo originated from the fact that I wanted to have a skull you know on the jackets too back then when the tattoos werent uuh uhhhm somehow not to be realized in the near future and stuff and I really wanted the skull So but they only had Heavy Metal skulls everywhere but theyre aggressive to me Thats a direction I didnt wanna follow So thats why we did it at the tshirt shop took it from a skeleton changed the glasses that means removed the eyes put in glasses added veins brought out the teeth  really brought them out for the smile so it would fit the name he shouldnt be aggressive maybe a bit  I dont understand that word at all but also the peace maker type Mr Geissen You want to be called Ice why Ice Mr Ice Thats right because its my name which I actually use now cut Because Mr Cool always somehow seemed very cool to me and since I dig Vanilla Ice I added the Ice Mr Geissen Please turn around a very interesting part of your body is your back and it says MR COOL ICE Why Mr Ice I just wanted to represent something cut I wanted something which is mine something because a lot of people wear brands or represent things which are well Id say its just puton Voiceover Thomas Steinberger aka Mr Cool Ice loves public appearances In the pedestrian zone and on tv The 33 year old man from Mainz got his body in shape for that reason and had his own logo tattooed on himself A tshirt shop helped him with the design TShirt guy named Josef He came into the shop all casual approached me came straight to the point and well then we did it together and it was actually funny It first seemed a bit crazy having to design a tattoo in Corel Draw since we usually only do tshirts but since it was for Ice  who we already know for quite some time right Mr Ice I made up the name myself so its mine patentregistered on me mmmh so I basically started here  by myself Frank wasnt there  to design the skull cut The logo originated from the fact that I wanted to have a skull you know on the jackets too back then when the tattoos werent uuh uhhhm somehow not to be realized in the near future and stuff and I really wanted the skull So but they only had Heavy Metal skulls everywhere but theyre aggressive to me Thats a direction

together for example Mr Ice I want people to ask to think about it if its true thats why it says on the top Mr Lover Lover below I put Mr Sex because thats my motto that I love sex just cool and geil geil is a stupid word which is basically used in the sense of cool awesome but also means horny that is for the stupid people who always think they have to put me in categories which doesnt work anyway Voiceover He already spent 4000 on his tattoos  according to Ice this investment in his body was worth it Actually he only wanted to have a few jackets printed  the thing with the tattoos was more or less coincidence Mr Ice I didnt really decide on it I was  I accompanied a buddy who always wanted a tattoo  who by the way hasnt got one to this day  and uhm was taken by surprise by the tattoo artist who said so your appointment is in two weeks and I was uhm uh  yeah and the problem is after your first one  not necessarily but you get addicted A tattoo is something youll have your whole life You should put a lot of thought in it and know if you just do it on a whim or because everybody else does it or to express something how do I want to express it where on what body I say Im Mr Cool Ice thats my name my thing and wont ruin it because its my whole body its my person and where I dont get away with it Im out of place anyway because I dont want to be there Voice Are there moments when you wish you didnt have any tattoos Mr Ice No Voice Never Mr Ice As soon as I get up and see myself in the mirror no Some might say its narcissistic but as I say to myself to do something like that you have to be a bit narcissistic Voiceover Mr Cool Ice  hes used that name for 13 years and for 5 years now its also on his body Mr Cool Ice sentence I dont understand Even without tattoos because some say I only got the tattoos to draw attention to myself so a long time ago I had longer hair and stuff but I was as crazy as I am now because a lot of people only see craziness in the tattoos or the name but thats not true Maybe I changed on the outside but my character and way of thought towards other people or regarding my life that never changed Voiceover in contrast to the colorful shows on tv Ice prefers tidiness discipline and housekeeping at home Mr Ice So it always looks very clean And down here theres nothing hidden all the cleaning supplies you see yeah its very very very very clean At my place its clean clean clean In my bathroom worse than a woman theres everything you need toothbrush toothbrush for visitors very important because I hate visiting other places and theres no toothbrush And no matter how drunk you should have a deodorant not just for yourself but for the others too A toilet should also be as clean as it is down here To all guys sit dont stand Because everybody who cleans up himself knows how talk show woman Mr Cool Ice will be very happy to appear here on stage because he describes himself as a male minx hellooooo random blah blah blonde woman sitting beside him youre ugly  Mr Ice Thats relative isnt it  blonde horrible horrible say what do you have here talk show woman what exactly is it a real minx does in your opinion Mr ice A minx is for me a woman who stands her ground and something more which I cant translate  geil dirty arrogant but with style and she maybe doesnt have that cut Im not a womanizer Im not macho Im not a sexbomb I always say I enjoy ladies and the other way round And I dont mean women have to do all the chores that would be too boring and I myself already clean up enough and like it Sex is very important to me not on top of the list but in second place and very big because if it doesnt work sexually even if the character or the whole person is great it wont work out Because Im a cheerful and above all sexual person I dont mean I have to have onenight stands or only half a year or a relationship forever the only thing I can say for sure is that I dont want to marry I always say my philosophy concerning marriage and getting children is getting married with 90 getting two children and dying with 120 Fidelity Fidelity is very important but basically things you dont want dont do to other people and let others live dont smother For Gods sake The longest relationship was three years I was faithful in every relationship So I had relationships well you cant call them relationships I enjoyed ladies I wasnt together with and that  I think he says something which means three at the same time but not in the foursome sense ahem but you have to be honest Voice How many ladies have you enjoyed so far Mr Ice Well Thats something I usually negate when people ask me I always say I love the ladies and then stupid gesture this guy really doesnt make sense sometimes voiceover His body is his everything so Ice works out regularly five times a week Mr Ice Fitness is awesome totally brilliant and I recommend it to everyone yeah Im against drugs of all kinds well I do drink alcohol sometimes sometimes one over the eight but when it comes to cigarettes pills heroin and so on  no I already work out for a couple of years and some might say hey you should have a really grandiose body by now but since I dont take drugs and partly worked out at home for a while its all natural And itll stay this way And well I need it During the years I worked out at home I missed something Thats maybe something like a drug like people always say Search Interest Know Your Meme Store External References 1 BME  Whats cooler than being cool 2 Democratic Underground  Calling

kindergarten Her parents are poor and live in a one bedroom with four kids so they dont care she sleeps over most nights Hang out almost everyday for years All our friends joke about us getting married one day She knows Im into her and she says she feels same way but doesnt want to label it Get her to make out but really not much more Says she likes me too much and is afraid well go all the way if we do anything more Resigned to being a virgin til I eventually many this girl Both of us mainly hang out with two other guys lets call Eric and Dave Mainly consists of playing Halo at my house Sometimes smoke weed when Eric can get it Talk about parties but never get invited Eric starts hanging out with his oldfag cousin sometimes Make fun of him for hanging out with 37 year old Says cousin buys beer and lets him smoke at his place wellwhydidnlyousaysointhefirstplacejpg Start going to his cousins place to drink and play halo once a week when his wife and kids are gone visiting wifes parents He buys the beer has food videogames not bad situation He can have a pretty annoying bossy attitude and thinks hes the king of our weekly hangs but whatever Start bringing the pseudogf to these things Cousin is always eyeing the fuck out of her but shes used to being the only girl at our hangs so whatever Sorry I suck at typing Even though this cousinfag knows that this girl should be off limits he is always flicking hitting on her Worst part is she doesnt seem to mind One day he asks her why it doesnt say Im her boyfriend on facebook mfw when she says Oh hes more like my best friend than anything seething anger when he says Man you gotta lock that shit down bro shes banging Only really see this cousinfag once a week and she still sleeps over all the time so thinking

ingrained at this point Eventually start combining Halo and drinking halo drinking games Were retards we didnt think of this sooner Old cousinfag instates random different rules all the time House rules he says Since pseudogf doesnt really play he sometimes has rules involving her She has to get the beers if theres a multikill shit like that One day he proposes she has to sit on lap of the guy who wins for the next game Randomly this oldfag is the best of us so rule is obviously for him I start to say Dude I dont think she wants When at the same time she laughs and says You boys implying okay Feel like a huge faggot for being too protective get red and just go with it She spends the majority of the next couple of hours on his lap Raging as we go home get in a fight with her make up as we always do Shit continues like this for the next few times Mostly lap sitting Sometimes they get her to do a joke sexy dance Nothing I can get publically too mad about My uncle has a wedding on the same day one of these hangs happens Ask her not to go She says she probably wont Ask her again basically begging this time She says shell try to get out of it but that the guys are pushy and shes bad at saying no Both true statements but I get mad at her telling her to have a spine Get in a fight again Dont have time to make up before leaving for wedding ihaveareallybadfeelingjpg Fidgeting entire

Jokers way of thinking and his philosophy hes Intelligent Nihilistic and with a Wicked Sense of Humor and his views on society speaks large about his character and i belive so as many of you do that if we add this line in the movie itll make it significantly better and will show more depth in the twisted mind of the Joker what i have in mind is a scene where the Joker sees a kid in a resturant playing Fortnite on his phone while his grandfather is reading a book insert book title here and he looks at them and says damn we live in a society he may say this line as he looks into the camera thus breaking the 4th wall Related Memes We Live in a Society We Live In a Society is a series of images that compare two similar things one popular and the other underacknowledged but complex using photoshopped social media reactions The image is also captioned by the phrase We live in a society implying that the cultural conception and opinion is wrong The format however is not to be confused

the online backlash against perceived breaches of journalistic integrity on video game news sites that occurred as a result of the Quinnspiracy an online controversy surrounding indie game developer Zoe Quinns alleged affairs with a number of men working in the video game industry including Kotaku staff writer Nathan Grayson The term has also since been used to describe the group of internet users based mainly on Twitter who claim that there is a lack of transparency within the video game journalism industry These same people have also been criticized of practicing misogyny and sexism by many through harassment and trolling referring to their opposition as social justice warriors Background The Zoe Post On August 16th 2014 game developer Zoe Quinns exboyfriend Eron Gjoni published an online expose detailing their relationship called the Zoe Post In the expose Gjoni claims Quinn cheated on him with several men in the gaming industry including Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson These claims were subsequently refuted by Kotaku editorinchief Steve Totilo in a post on the website76 In this post he claims that the only time Nathan mentioned Quinn was in a post about a gaming competition known as GameJam77 The day following the publication of the Zoe Post YouTuber MundaneMatt uploaded a video critiquing Quinns game Depression Quest and commenting on the alleged affairs with men working in the video game industry3 The video was subsequently removed due to a copyright claim allegedly by Quinn for using a still image from the game2 On August 18th YouTuber Internet Aristocrat uploaded the first in a series of videos titled Quinnspiracy Theory in which he discusses the issue of cronyism in gaming media and the indie game development community Ethics in Gaming Journalism As concerns over the alleged integrity of gaming journalists increased it was discovered that several were actively contributing money to Quinns Patreon account56 including Polygon editor Ben Kuchera who had been donating to Quinn for several weeks prior to writing an article about her game Kotaku writer Patricia Hernandez subsequently came under scrutiny as well when gamers began investigating her alleged romantic relationships with other video game developers7 Similarly many criticized sound designer Robin Arnott for having an alleged affair with Quinn while appearing as a judge in the Indiecade game competition which gave Quinn an award for Depression Quest8 On August 26th Kotaku4 editor Stephen Totilo posted a statement regarding the gaming news sites code of ethics announcing that Kotaku journalists would not be allowed to contribute to the Patreon accounts of game developers The same day Polygon11 followed up with a similar statement announcing that all writers must disclose any contributions they have made to developers Patreon accounts Readers later released a statement condemning Polygons new ethics policy for being unsatisfactory9 Some criticized the new policies for being unfair while others suggested the policy change was the result of sexism and misogyny rKotakuinAction On August 24th 2014 the rKotakuInAction subreddit was launched by Redditor103 davidme Modeled after the name of another social justice reactionary subreddit called rTumblrinAction rKotakuinAction quickly established itself as one of the earliest adhoc communities to emerge in the wake of the scandal amassing nearly 100000 subscribers within its three years of existence As the public interest in GamerGate began to decline in the latter half of the decade rKotakuinAction became a broader social hub and a forum for those who share skeptical or critical views on the rise of social justice and the culture of political correctness Sexism in Gaming Culture After the Zoe Post many commentators online including social justice bloggers began to condemn the gaming industry and the culture surrounding it for being filled with sexism and misogyny Many news sites began to report on these allegations many of which saw this alleged harassment as proof of the sexism rooted within gaming culture787980 Among those who were targeted by this harassment included video game developer Brianna Wu81 and actresslivestreamer Felicia Day82 On October 29th 2014 video game critic Anita Sarkessian appeared on Stephen Colberts latenight news show The Colbert Report to discuss sexism in the gaming industry83 The clip of Sarkessian and Colberts discussion was later uploaded to Comedy Centrals YouTube channel shown below and was reported on by various sites such as The Verge84 and The Washington Post85 Notable Developments GamerGate On August 27th actor Adam Baldwin posted a tweet linking to Internet Aristocrat videos along with the hashtag GamerGate1 In the first week the hashtag was tweeted over 244000 times13 according to the Twitter analytics site Topsy shown below left By November the hashtag had been tweeted just over 18 million times in the prior month with an average of 50000 tweets per day shown below right AntiGamer Backlash  The End of Gamers On August 28th several news sites published articles calling for an end to the gamer cultural identity including The Financial Post Ars Technica The Daily Beast The Stranger Beta Beat Gamasutra Polygon and Kotaku shown below On September 1st journalists and independent developers involved in this antigamer movement published a signed open letter to the gaming community asking gamers to end the harassment towards critics and developers15 The following day software engineer Benjamin Quintero published an article on Gamasutra questioning the strategy of gaming sites deliberately alienating their core readers by denouncing their culture16 Shortly after Quintero tweeted that he had been downgraded by the video gaming news blog On August 30th the GamerGate Harassment Tumblr10 blog was launched which chronicled harassment of gamers by those associated with the online social justice community On September 3rd YouTuber Boogie2988 uploaded a video responding to accusations of bigotry toward those who support GamerGate shown below In the first 24 hours the video gained over 111000 views and 7000 comments Bloggers vs Journalists Once the calls for journalistic integrity began to grow louder various writers for mainstream gaming media outlets started publicly rejecting the title of journalist and began referring to themselves as bloggers During the PAX Prime 2014 QA panel on August 29th several panelists made a point to repeatedly declare themselves as not journalists Contrary to the trend however Kotaku stated that it hired journalists and not bloggers TheQuinnspiracya a hrefhttpstwittercomStevenBeynonStevenBeynon Kotaku is staffed by journalists Not bloggers Jason Schreier jasonschreier 27 augustus 2014 GameOverGate On September 5th Zoe Quinn posted a series of compiled screenshots from an IRC chat claiming it as evidence that GamerGate was a conspiracy started by 4chan to get people to harass women and gaming journalists Immediately afterward the hashtag Gameovergate17 was created by Quinns followers to mock the gamergate movement14 On the following day The Escapist Magazines Cofounder Alexander Archon Macris visited the IRC channel to cover their side of the story in an article18 In the article the members of the channel shared how all the screenshots Quinn showed were taken out of context to mislead viewers or written by trolls attempting to disrupt the channel who were subsequently banned Additional chatlogs19 were provided for the missing context GameJournoPros Mailing List After several articles critical of the gamer identity were being posted on gaming news websites people began speculating that journalists had worked together to promote a narrative against gamers that disagreed with them On September 17th Brietbart staff writer Milo Yiannopoulos posted a tweet hinting he had obtained information about a coordinated approach used by journalists who wrote the articles shown below Later that day Breitbart 20 published and article titled Exposed The Secret Mailing List of the Gaming Journalism Elite revealing a private Google group mailing list titled GameJournoPros purportedly used by gaming journalists cooperating to work against GamerGate The article contained several screenshots taken from the mailing list which discussed ways to approach the topic of Zoe Quinn and the GamerGate controversy shown below Julian Assanges Reddit AMA On September 15th Wikileaks founder Julian Assange participated in an ask me anything thread on the rIAmA22 subreddit to answer about his new book When Google Met WikiLeaks After Redditor ShaskaOtselot asked for his opinion censorship of GamerGate discussions on Reddit Assange replied that it was pathetic After another Redditor pointed out that ShaskaOtselot had been shadowbanned Assange edited the post to point out that a user had been banned for asking him a question about censorship On the same day Julian Assange tweeted about this event using the hashtag gamergate2324 It was later revealed that the user was shadowbanned months prior for

communicated and thats my fault Said threads are being deleted primarily because they violate our blanket no personal information  raids  calls to invasion rule Spamming the reports system and creating multiple topics were also a factor especially given v is one of 4chans fastest moving boards and has historically struggled with keeping topics limited to actual video games Regarding a perceived lack of free speechcensorship  many seem to misinterpret my advocating for anonymous communication and highlighting that it allows people to share things they otherwise wouldnt be comfortable with on other platforms as you can say and do anything on 4chan which simply isnt the case Weve had rules and moderators since the site was founded 11 years ago and Ive only reinforced

their regret of having started the subreddit In the post he criticized the attitudes and actions of the users of rKotakuInAction the GamerGate movement and Reddit They wrote KiA is one of the many cancerous growths that have infiltrated reddit The internet The world I did this Now I am undoing it This abomination should have always been aborted So in this moment with years of contemplation I am Stopping it Im closing shop and I cant allow anyone to exploit my handicap Ive watched and read every day Every single day The mods are good at what they do but they are moderating over a sub that should not exist The users have created content that should not be Topics that do not require debate And often times molded by outside forces We are better than this I should have been better than this Just look at the comment history of any users history The hate is spread by very few but very often Overwhelmingly so Reddit and its Admins are Me They are the stewards of hate and divisiveness and they let it go They go so far as to even claim there is nothing they can do about it Those with upvotes could have been stopped by others with equally powerful downvotes Fallacy 100 evil people with 100000 upvotes can not be defeated by 100000 with 100 downvotes Dont let Reddit pretend otherwise They know what goes on here They know everything So either they choose to allow it or  makes them Corporate needs s Bigger the number the better This is UnAmerican and everything wrong with what is now the inevitable result of true capitalism 10000 people living in destitution can never effectively stand up to the 1 who control everything Incorporation Copyrights monopolie a result We are a Democratic Republic and the winners created institutions where the losers keep losing Small business need to thrive if we are to be a healthy nation Incorporations will always lead to monopolies There is no other outcome They paid their way invested into feigning the populace that they are doing what is in their best interest Righting a Wrong Beginnings I created KIA thinking no one would join and when I awoke I had many hundreds of orangereds Wow WTF did I say or do that caused this KiA began Im surprised and excited that we had over 100 users So I began So it began I created a few rudimentary rules and began enforcing them The next days added a couple hundred and then a few thousand This was becoming a monster The Birth I was moderating 247 and it was clear that I could not sustain these rules on my own These rules were the site rules Dont break them and you dont get banned Its only fair Free speech needs protection even unwanted and hurtful speech Hate speech was allowed but I was having difficulty defining everything Does saying nigger cunt as a noun the same as using it as a verb So I began seeking help from users that I believed had the subreddits purpose and shared my own vision for its future Moderation Im not sure how but it was a success The next top mod was an A personality and highly knowledgeable of the subs content Amazing Everything was going as planned Despite JRs infiltration and attempted creation of a scandal TwasIWhoShotJR We began a great chat IRC and then even began livestreams Sometimes with famous guests having insane meltdowns That was drama Going forward We worked on creating fundamental rules and attempting to wrestle with how to define what content was acceptable We still cant get this perfect despite public outcry and threats The next steps Everything was going as planned and as its creator and top moderator I was able to give shape and vision to its continued future In doing so we over moderated At least we thought we were Bans up the wazoo and massive amounts of removed comments In retrospect we were mostly unable to as users found ways around the rules We did get better Hate This was a dark time We were wrestling with how to control hate speech Not only what was said but what people could link to KiA became infested with racism and sexism  and other isms  though many isms are not real GG forums were created on KiwiFarms and 8chan as a result This was the best and worst thing The monster was now a virus We banned links to and then mention of certain links and topics Now we became the enemy A new phase This is when I handed over supervisory control I really wanted to close the sub I was in the process of until I was superseded not to Ive been wanting to close every day since I was just too scared of the backlash How ironic is that Ive been trying to please everyone when I should be forcing my wants and visions for the subreddit to be executed I rolled over and played dead After this nothing much matters I was too weak I let the other mods dictate My own flaws and faults compromised my ability to raise my iron fist This was a monumental failure Im ASD and GAD Many of you know this Many of you dont believe this I have allowed myself confidence and an ability to assert myself Ive been captive my entire life and now I have the ability to make my own decisions and to correct my mistakes KiA is a huge one I think about this daily and dream about it Its a boogeyman The monster under my bed in my head Until now KiA is one of the many cancerous growths that have infiltrated reddit The internet The world I did this Now I am undoing it This abomination should have always been aborted So in this moment with years of contemplation I am Stopping it Im closing shop and I cant allow anyone to exploit my handicap Ive watched and read every day Every single day The mods are good at what

itch yet you are a viral cancer that is destroying the minds of millions of Reddit users each day And they allow it They in fact have to Conflict breeds users and drives viewer counts driving advertisers and required profits After all who would invest in a company that loses money Reddit is only a small problem but Ill end it here Those with power use it to create a stronger hold on that power Human nature to be 1 At least Reddit is sooo overly tolerant that they could never remove this post httpswwwusagovregistertovote httpswwwindivisibleorg Thanks to ironcally Google This looks like and sounds like a rant Its not Its a warning Free the free press The 1st amendment demands it KotakuinAction has beed a wildly successful failure in this endevour of The 1st Thanks rThe_donald  Youve shown me the darkness Im hoping to pave your way to the light The post has since been removed from rKotakuInAction and placed on rdrama104 Following the post the subreddit was briefly shutdown That day rKotakuInAction moderator HandofBane posted about the outage105 They wrote So some of you may have noticed as the 60ish modmails asking what happened can affirm that the sub went private for about 4550 minutes not too long ago Heres what happened davidme apparently went off the deep end making a long screed post on another sub about nuking KiA as he made KiA private kicked the entire mod team nuked the CSS and generally made a clusterfuck of things Thankfully an amazing admin was online who helped restore everything and has locked davids permissions to mailonly while an investigation goes on into the matter later before they decide if anything further needs to be done We dont expect him to stay at the top of the list afterward but thats more in the admins hands than ours right now He was supposed to act as an emergency failsafe in case one of us did what he did to the sub  clearly he failed at that role In the mean time we are sorting out whats still broken and what we can fix easily Flairs may not be fully back but some appear to be We are seeing what else isnt quite working right if you notice something not working how it did yesterday please drop us a modmail so we can look into fixing it Apologies to everyone for the downtime hopefully this gets sorted out to where that can never happen again Search Interest Know Your Meme Store External References 1 Adam Baldwin

hours has had adverse effects on the staff they claim Some reported health issues from exhaustion and stress while others claimed it created a toxic work environment This was compounded by reports that employees would often work weekends and find it difficult to take away from work One anonymous employee said I work an average 70 hours a week Theres probably at least 50 or even 100 other people at Epic working those hours I know people who pull 100hour weeks The company gives us unlimited time off but its almost impossible to take the time If I take time off the workload falls on other people and no one wants to be that guy These employees said that the issues stem from the frequent updates that are necessary to keep Fortnite popular These patches require near constant attention creating a heftier and more demanding workload A spokesperson for the company said Fortnite achieved a far higher level of success than we had ever anticipated Everybody throughout Epic responded to the success with incredible vigor and commitment The Fortnite team rapidly expanded the game to grow the audience the Unreal Engine team began a broad effort to optimize for 60fps and support seven platforms others throughout the company moved to Fortnite to maintain momentum However employees have disputed that executives have done anything to make the work environment more tenable Some have said that to push back or even leave work can be a mark against their character This is especially true for contract employees who claim not working these expected long hours could result in not having their contracts renewed One employee told Polygon One senior guy would say Just get more bodies Thats what the contractors were called bodies And then when were done with them we can just dispose of them They can be replaced with fresh people who dont have the toxic nature of being disgruntled That day Redditor48 Mlghubben1e posted about the report in the rapexlegends subreddit The post received mroe tahn 16000 points 89 upvoted and 1700 comments in two days The issue was also discussed on Twitter with people sharing their opinions about the expos examples below Search Interest

July of 2006 in Lake Tahoe Nevada one year after Trump had married Melania and four months after she gave birth to Barron Trump Cohen did not address the rumored payout but said in a statement that both Trump and Clifford denied the allegation Cohen provided a statement from Clifford in which she denied the allegations of a payout writing My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more When I met Donald Trump he was gracious professional and a complete gentleman to me and EVERYONE in my presence Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump trust me you wouldnt be reading about in the news you would be reading about it in my book But the fact of the matter is these stories are not true Developments While Clifford denied the allegations stories confirming the affair had been circulating in media well before the Wall Street Journals report CNN2 reported that Fox News reporter Diana Falzone had submitted the story to Fox News editors in October of 2016 and had the story corroborated by Cliffords manager Gina Rodriguez but Fox News never ran the story claiming they could never verify it The New York Times3 reported that Jacob Weisberg editor in chief of the Slate Group confirmed that Clifford had interviewed with Slate between August and October of 2016 about the affair and confirmed that Cohen had agreed to pay her 130000 for her silence However before Slate ran the story Clifford ceased communication with the publication Furthermore InTouch4 has an interview from 2011 in which Clifford confirmed the sexual encounter Their evidence confirming Cliffords truthfulness includes corroborations by Daniels friend Randy Spears and her exhusband Mike Moz Clifford also took and passed a polygraph test at the time of the interview According to sources familiar with the matter InTouch will be running the unedited 5500word interview they conducted with Clifford which includes details of Trumps performance in bed and pillow talk Another portion of the interview which generated headlines is a section where Clifford says We had really good banter He told me once that I was someone to be reckoned with beautiful smart just like his daughter referring to Ivanka Trump cover shown below The story has been covered by multiple major news publications including Mother Jones5 Daily Beast6 and Twitter Moments7 InTouch Interview On January 18th 2018 InTouch magazine posted the unedited transcript of Cliffords interview with them from 2011 about her affair with Donald Trump8 Clifford described Trumps performance in bed as textbook generic though she described him as nice in their conversation beforehand and that he attempted to get her on The Apprentice According to Clifford afterwards Trump attempted to contact her several times to initiate more hook ups but it never worked out One of the stories in the interview that caught the attention of media organizations was Trumps intense fandom of Discovery Channels Shark Week After meeting with Clifford to let her know he could not get her on The Apprentice she alleges he was glued to watching Shark Week The strangest thing about that night  this was the best thing ever You could see the television from the little dining room table and he was watching Shark Week and he was watching a special about the USS something and it sank and it was like the worst shark attack in history He is obsessed with sharks Terrified of sharks He was like I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks I hope all the sharks die He was like riveted He was like obsessed Its so strange I know The Shark Week anecdote was covered by Uproxx9 and The Daily Dot10 Forbes Magazine Spanking Rumor The same day the InTouch interview was published Mother Jones11 posted an article about emails from 2009 they had uncovered from political advisors to Clifford Andrea Dub and a second anonymous consultant who exchanged anecdotes about Cliffords alleged sexual encounter with Trump In addition to the Shark Week anecdote one of the consultants says Clifford told them that Trump asked to be spanked with a copy of Forbes Magazine The anonymous consultant further alleges that Trump asked to be spanked with a copy of Forbes magazine with himself on the cover Mother Jones identified a 2006 issue of Forbes featuring Donald Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr on the cover as the possible magazine in question Michael Cohens Delaware LLC According to a report published by the Wall Street Journal12 on January 18th Michael Cohen used private company Essential Consultants LLC to pay Clifford 130000 on October 17th 2016 two weeks prior to the election The report alleges Cohen and Clifford used pseudonyms to complete the transaction Common Cause Complaints On January 22nd 2018 political watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of complaints to the Justice Department and Federal Elections Commission that the alleged 130000 sum paid to Clifford two weeks prior to the election amounted to an inkind campaign donation that was illegally undisclosed on official reports of the Trump campaigns finances13 They argue that because the money was paid so as not to damage the chances of Trump in the general election they should be considered campaign money An attorney for Common Cause Paul Ryan not to be confused with House Speaker Paul Ryan compared the situation to to the events that led to North Carolina senator John Edwards prosecution over 1 million he paid to cover up an affair he had with videographer Rielle Hunter14 Edwards was acquitted of the charges Republican campaign finance lawyer Jan Baran countered Common Causes argument saying that in both Trumps and Edwards cases money spent for a candidate is not necessarily money spent for a campaign and therefore is not a regulated contribution or expenditure Both times the purpose of the expense was highly personal to say the least and not campaign related in the legal sense On January 22nd Citizens For Ethics tweeted that the Trump campaign transferred 130000 to Trump businesses sarcastically suggesting it was probably just coincidence shown below Daniels Kimmel Appearance On January 30th 2018 Clifford as Daniels released a statement of denial of an affair with Trump The letter was posted by Buzzfeed News editor Tom Namako on Twitter16 after it was acquired by investigations reporter Anthony Cormier shown below The text of the statement reads To Whom It May Concern Over the past few weeks I have been asked countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship I had with Donald Trump many many many years ago The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged affair denied its existence in 2006 20011 sic 2016 2017 and now again in 2018 I am not denying this affair because I was paid hush money as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids I am denying this affair because it never happened I will have no further comment on this matter Please feel free to check me out on Instagram at thestormydaniels Thank you Stormy Daniels Later that evening she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to discuss the allegations During the interview Kimmel noticed the signature on the statement did not look like Daniels signatures on other documents Kimmel provided When Kimmel bluntly asked if she had signed the document Daniels replied I dont know did I and also said That does not look like my signature The interview continued in this fashion with Daniels giving noncommittal answers leading Kimmel to conclude that she may have signed a nondisclosure agreement shown below Later that evening Cormier tweeted a response from Daniels lawyer who stated that Stormy did indeed sign both denials  I thought stormy did a fantastic job on Jimmy Kimmel tonight She was having fun on Kimmel and being her normal playful self17 The story was covered by Daily Dot18 and Uproxx19 Michael Cohens Admission On February 13th 2018 The New York Times20 reported that Michael Cohen admitted in a statement to them that hed paid Stormy Daniels the rumored sum of 130000 dollars He claimed he did this out of his own pocket and was not reimbursed for the payment and it was not a campaign expenditure He said the Trump Campaign and Trump Organization were not a aware of the transaction Cohen still argued that the affair didnt happen saying Just because something isnt true doesnt mean that it cant cause you harm or damage I will always protect Mr Trump He then refused to answer the Times followup questions including whether Mr Trump had been aware that Mr Cohen made the payment why he made the payment or whether he had made similar payments to other people over the years Cohen said he made a similar statement to the Federal Elections Commission and that the complaint made by Common Cause that the payment acted as a sort of inkind campaign contribution had no legal basis He stated he would not make further comment regarding the matter News organizations were skeptical of Cohens excuse CNN21 wrote that the explanation didnt pass the smell test writing Dont overthink it Cohen  out of the goodness of his heart  dropped a sixfigure payment to a porn star even though he didnt believe her allegations that she and the President had an affair after the birth of his son Barron I mean come on The Washington Post22 found that Cohens lack of denial that Trump had anything to do with the payment was a potential implication of the President in the deal They raised the possibility that Cohens language left room for interpretation that he had been a middle man in a larger transaction and suggested it was highly doubtful that Cohen would make such a payment without Trump knowing about the transaction Daniels Lawsuit Against Donald Trump In a lawsuit filed March 6th 2018 to a Los Angeles court23 Daniels claims the hush agreement she had with Trump is nonbinding because Trump never signed the document Attached to the lawsuit is the full hush agreement negotiated between Trump Daniels and Cohen The agreement uses pseudonymsTrumps pseudonym is David Dennison and Daniels is Peggy Peterson A side letter agreement reveals the true names David Dennison did not sign the agreement as Peggy Peterson had on October 28th 2016 Because of this omission Daniels believes she is free to discuss the affair she had with Trump The inclusion of Trump in the agreement undermines Cohens claim that he had paid the hush money out of his own pocket without Trumps knowledge24 Additionally the lawsuit came one day after The Wall Street Journal25 reported that Cohens payment to Daniels was marked as suspicious by the Treasury Department and that Cohen had privately complained that he had not been reimbursed for the hush money The morning of March 7th Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti appeared on The Today Show to discuss the lawsuit He alleged that Daniels and Trump did have an affair and argued it was ludicrous for Cohen to suggest Trump did not know about the payment Watch savannahguthriea39s full

the Love Sponge Clem Interview On March 14th 2018 CNN32 reported that Daniels had appeared on a 2007 radio show in Florida with local host Bubba the Love Sponge Clem in which she discussed her affair with Donald Trump Clem played segments from the interview on his show on March 9th and March 12th Though neither Clem nor Daniels mentioned Trump by name the details in the interview align with details Daniels provided about her affair with Trump CNN verified Clems assertion that Daniels was talking about Trump Daniels Crowdfunding Campaign On March 13th 2018 Daniels launched a crowdfunding campaign on CrowdJustice30 for legal fees for her lawsuit against Trump In her statement on CrowdJustice Daniels wrote that she offered to return the 130000 of hush money she received from Michael Cohen in order to be able to speak freely of her affair with Trump Cohen did not acknowledge the offer She also accuses Cohen of threatening her with a 1 million fine for every time she spoke openly about Trump She requests funds for attorneys fees outofpocket costs associated with the lawsuit arbitration and my right to speak openly security expenses and damages that may be awarded against me if I speak out and ultimately lose to Mr Trump and Mr Cohen The campaign was covered by The Daily Beast31 60 Minutes Interview On March 25th 2018 CBS 60 Minutes aired an interview with Daniels in which she detailed her affair with Trump32 In the interview Daniels detailed how their meetings were consensual but she was never attracted to Trump She described the affair as practically a business deal She went into detail about the methods with which Trump associates threatened her to keep her from talking about the affair confirmed the rumor that Trump asked to be spanked with a copy of Forbes magazine and also confirmed the rumor that Trump had said she reminded him of his daughter Ivanka Internet users joked about the more salacious details of the interview and also remarked that the interviewer Anderson Cooper appeared as though he were trying not to laugh during the interview Twitter reactions were shared under the hashtag StormyDanielsDay33 and were covered by Uproxx32 Dilated Pupils Conspiracy Theory Following the 60 Minutes interview some online claimed that Daniels was high on drugs during the taping citing her pupils which appeared to be dilated as evidence Twitter34 user j3nnp4c3 tweeted at Danielss lawyer Michael Avenatti a closeup picture of Daniels during the interview shown below left with the caption I would urge your client to lay off the crack while on tv Even the bright lights couldnt shrink those coked out pupils Twitter35 user mjgranger1 also posted a picture shown below center with the caption 60Minutes Stormy Daniels pupils are so large even with bright lights in her face you cant see her iriss Can you say medication realDonaldTrump Conspiracy theorist Mark Dice tweeted35 a variation of the Cocaine Marijuana Beer meme with Danielss eyes in the first box He captioned the post Whats up with this floozy Stormy Daniels massively dilated pupils during her 60 Minutes interview The post shown below right received more than 1100 retweets and 2300 likes in two days This theory has been debunked because there is no way to to know for sure what caused her pupils dilate Studies show the pupils dilate because of emotional changes or memory which is a more common reason for pupil dilation than drugs37 When people attempt to retrieve an old memory or remembering an old question both processes that an interviewee undergoes their pupils can dilate Assistant professor at LSU Megan Papesh said It is absolutely wrong to assume that someone is on drugs legal or illegal based on dilated pupils  There is simply no way to know for sure what caused her pupils to dilate Being interviewed for 60 Minutes is surely exciting or nervewracking and both of those would reasonably cause dilation Several media outlets covered the conspiracy theory including The Daily Dot38 Business Insider The Daily Mail39 and more Michael Cohen Raided by FBI On April 9th 2018 the FBI raided Michael Cohens office and New York City hotel room seizing business records emails and documents related to the Stormy Daniels case40 In a statement Cohens lawyer Stephen Ryan said he was told by federal prosecutors that the action was in part a referral by the office of special counsel Robert Mueller Donald Trump spoke to reporters about the raid later that day criticizing the ongoing FBI investigation as a witchhunt criticized Attorny General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russiagate investigation and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and once again floated the idea of firing Robert Mueller41 Federal guidelines suggest Rosenstein would have approved the raid The following morning Trump tweeted Attorneyclient privilege is dead and A TOTAL WITCH HUNT shown below It is unclear as of April 10th what the FBI hopes to find and what information they had to prompt the raid Former US Attorney Preet Bahara who served in the Southern District of New York was quoted as saying Its being done because people think its very serious people

federal judge in California66 dismissed the lawsuit stating Trumps tweet was protected by the First Amendment If this court were to prevent Mr Trump from engaging in this type of rhetorical hyperbole against a political adversary it would significantly hamper the office of the president Any stronglyworded response by a president to another politician or public figure could constitute an action for defamation The decision also included the demand that Daniels pay Trumps legal fees On Twitter Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti announced his plan to appeal the decision to the 9th Circuit Court of

his lawyers appeared on Sean Hannity and confirmed that Trump had reimbursed the 130000 hush money Michael Cohen made to Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 Presidential Election However he did so out of his personal funds and did not do so with campaign money or money from the Trump Organization quote shown below5253 Having something to do with paying some Stormy Daniels woman 130000 I mean which is going to turn out to be perfectly legal That money was not campaign money sorry Im giving you a fact now that you dont know Its not campaign money No campaign finance violation They funneled through a law firm and the president repaid it Sean everybody was nervous about this from the very beginning I wasnt I knew how much money Donald Trump put into that campaign and I said 130000 He could do a couple of checks for 130000 When I heard of Cohens retainer of 35000 when he was doing no work for the president I said thats how hes repaying  thats how hes repaying it with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes for Michael He didnt know about the specifics of the arrangement as far as I know But he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this This directly contradicted a statement Trump made in April in which he said he had no knowledge of the payment Cohen made to Daniels54 In a followup interview with The Washington Post55 Giuliani confirmed that him saying the President had repaid the money was not an accident and that hed planned with Trump to say what he did in a public forum Costa So the president is not angry with what you said tonight He was well aware youd bring it up Giuliani Oh yeah yeah Sure sure He was well aware that at some point when I saw the opportunity I was going to get this over with Costa Is that what you had talked about with him in recent days Giuliani Probably four or five days ago Following the interview Trump tweeted a statement admitting to the payment and reaffirmed the payment did not come from campaign money56 The three tweets read Mr Cohen an attorney received a monthly retainer not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties known as a nondisclosure agreement or NDA These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms Clifford Daniels The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair Prior to its violation by Ms Clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement Money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no roll in this transaction Twitter users noticed that the date of the payment October 27th 2016 came the day before the bombshell James Comey Letter about Hillary Clintons Email Investigation which came out two weeks before the election and arguably played a large role in its outcome Giuliani appeared to be aware of the upcoming Comey Letter when he appeared on Fox News on October 26th and said We got a couple things up our sleeve that should turn this around57 Twitter users argued that the timing of the payment made could possibly make it a legal issue as if the payment had political motivations the fact it was not disclosed could still violate campaign finance law Online Redditors took to memeing the interview by grabbing a screenshot where Giuliani appeared surprised A post on

central role in the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal They came to the conclusion after interviews with three dozen people who have direct knowledge of the events or who have been briefed on them as well as court papers corporate records and other documents68 The Wall Street Journal found that Trump was briefed or involved in every step of the process and the US attorneys office in Manhattan gathered evidence of Trumps participation Tapes found in the Michael Cohen raid reveal conversations between Cohen and Trump in which Trump agreed to pay Karen McDougal 150000 as well as discussions for the Stormy Daniels payment The Wall Street journal recounts Um I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David you know so thatIm going to do that right away said Mr Cohen according to a copy of the audio file As Mr Cohen explained his plans Mr Trump spoke over him So what are we gonna payOnefifty Mr Trump asked Mr Cohen paused

other ways Michael has not treated me with the respect and deference an attorney should show to a client He has spoken on my behalf without my approval He filed a defamation case against Donald Trump against my wishes He repeatedly refused to tell me how my legal defense fund was being spent Now he has launched a new crowdfunding campaign using my face and name without my permission and

made by Daniels explaining how the money was being spent He wrote I am and have always been Stormys biggest champion I have personally sacrificed an enormous amount of money time and energy toward assisting her because I believe in her I have always been an open book with Stormy as to all aspects of her cases and she knows that The retention agreement Stormy signed back in February provided that she would pay me 10000 and that any and all other monies raised via a legal fund would go toward my legal fees and costs Instead the vast majority of the money raised has gone toward her security expenses and similar other expenses The most recent campaign was simply a refresh of the prior campaign designed to help defray some of Stormys expenses Stormy Daniels AVN Awards Appearance On January

  <textRepresentation>rewrite in progress please stand by Something Awful commonly referred to as SA is a comedic website and forum community Something Awful is notable for being one of the oldest and largest forums in continuous existence and for the influence it has had on the online community History Begining Something Awful was originally created by Richard Lowtax Kyanka in 1999 1 Kyanka under the persona Cranky Steve was originally the only writer for the sites commedy section although in later years additional writers would join him Early in the sites history several advertisers including GameFan 2 and eFront 3 failed to pay their owed revenue to the site This prompted Kyanka to begin charging a 999 registration fee to forum users in 2001 The SPEWS Incident On July 2003 Something Awful was unexpectedly blocked by the Spam Prevention Early Warning System SPEWS allegedly due to a spammer sharing the same subnet of SA SPEWS initially refused to unblock the site upon appeal despite there being no connection between Something Awful and the alleged spam cutting off the sites ability to reach a large swathe of its users Kyanka and the admins encouraged users to vocalize their support for the site This backfired and ended in a wave of trolling offtopic posting on SPEWS websites ironically perpetuating the spam SA was trying to distance itself from and threats of mass DDoS attacks on SPEWS hosts Something Awful was eventually delisted and the site returned to normal Hurricane Katrina Something Awful went temporarily offline in 2005 due to its servers which were located in New Orleans being shut down by Hurricane Katrina Because of this Something Awful users created a fund to donate via the Red Cross money to Hurricane Katrina survivors Kyanka donated 3000 of his own money to the fund and promised free merchandize to anyone who donated over 10 In the halfday of the funds operation it raised 27695 before Paypal shut it down due to suspicion of fraud After learning that Paypal would only allow the money to be donated to United Way which users of the site considered rife with corruption the money was refunded to the donors About A good five minutes on SA shorthand for somethingawful will tell everything you need to know Its main center of lulzy byproducts come from its forums There are four main sections in the forum the Main Discussion The Finer Arts and Archives In those sections are smaller subforums which then bring you to the threads While the Main section only consists of General Bullshit the other sections have a wide variety such as gaming lets play movies books gadgets comedy and more The forums have helped to perpetuate Internet memes such as All your base are belong to us and Tourist guy The forums users refer to themselves as Goons A weekly activity is Photoshop Phriday where users will modify existing images to create parodies through the use of imageediting software such as Adobe Photoshop Another periodic activity is The Blue Ball Machine where users create animated images that tile together in such a way as to appear like a seamless whole these tiles are incorporated into a screensaver which displays them in random order The feature gained popularity when users on the website YTMND looped the animation to music from Peewees Big Adventure The website also highlights some of what its administrators believe to be exceptional forum threads in the Comedy Goldmine feature A forum member also launched 4chan During Entertainment Weeklys 2001 Entertainer of the Year contest in which votes are submitted online forum users quickly found a weakness in the voting system and scripts were written to vote for Kyanka dozens of times per second thus ensuring his victory Kyanka was quickly disqualified when Entertainment Weekly found that many of the votes were coming from very few IP addresses Kyanka did however get his name mentioned on their website Online Reputation Something Awful has a reputation for being a meme factory All Your Base Are Belong To Us is one example of a meme popularized by SA forum Goons Something Awful also has something of a reputation for griefing 4 4chan found moot frequented Something Awful forums before he created his own site 5 External References 1 Interview with Richard Kyanka Hypothermia 2 LowEndMac Something Awful  Expresscom 3 The Duke of URL Efront 4 Wiredcom Mutilated Furries Flying Phalluses 5 The Star Funny how Stupid Site is Addictive</textRepresentation>

  <textRepresentation>Steamed Hams is a memorable skit between Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers on the animated sitcom The Simpsons The scene has been a popular reference point for fans who have recontextualized quotes from the skit making it the frequent subject of shitposting on Facebook and YouTube Origin Steamed Hams comes from a scene in the Simpsons episode 22 Short Films About Springfield which first aired on April 14th 19961 In the episode which is an anthology of 22 short scenes about several of the citizens of Springfield the character Principal Skinner has Superintendent Chalmers over for dinner in a play on the dinner with the boss sitcom trope shown below2 The dinner as per the trope does not go according to plan as Skinner burns dinner leading him to cover the truth about dinner through elaborate and increasingly unbelievable series of lies After burning dinner and telling Chalmers that hes making steamed clams for dinner Skinner attempts to convince Chalmers that what he had prepared steamed hams for dinner an expression for hamburgers he says which is native to Albany New York3 Principal Skinner Superintendent I hope youre ready for mouthwatering hamburgers Superintendent Chalmers I thought we were having steamed clams Principal Skinner Oh no I said steamed hams Thats what I call hamburgers Superintendent Chalmers You call hamburgers steamed hams Principal Skinner Yes its a regional dialect Superintendent Chalmers Uhhuh What region Principal Skinner Uh upstate New York Superintendent Chalmers Really Well Im from Utica and I never heard anyone use the phrase steamed hams Principal Skinner Oh not in Utica no its an Albany expression Superintendent Chalmers I see While the line has been quoted by fans since the episode aired one of the earliest examples of it being used online comes from a November 15th 2007 Urban Dictionary post by user Delaware Mike4 who defines Steamed Hams as Hamburgers An Albany New York expression its not to be confused with steamed clams Spread On November 8th 2009 the Facebook group Steamed Hams launched As of May 2017 the group has amassed more than 7700 likes and 7600

associated with the expression do you know the way which is typically spoken in a mock African accent and phonetically spelled as do you know de wey Along with the question in hand a VR user will start making spitting sounds followed by a mob like mentality Unsuspecting VRchat users fall victim to Ugandan Knuckles promise of showing de wey Only followed by a mass trolling Origin On August 7th

the users of VRChat Please do not use this to bug the users of Vrchat Its community means a lot to me and it would hurt me to see the rights of other users taken away and possibly restricted because of how out of hand it can get Showing off their creativity and what they are capable of For me Im in college and dont have a lot of time to get on like I would like to anymore I remember making this and thinking Well it could be funny to show off to my friends and possibly mess with users But Ive learned what kind of things Im really capable of making Its always fun to be the one with models no one else has access to Because I can make anything that I want to be Its like Its like that special place for me To get away from the real world and be someone Im not But right now Vrchat has become a meme ground and I feel I have helped to dig a grave for Vrchat Soon enough people are gunna get tired of all the memes that now pollute the servers And with 500 people trying to just enjoy an event they cant because there just isnt enough moderation to hold down the rampant amounts of memers So please Think about the users that youre playing with Before they are all gone Dont let it be a second Second Life The following day Ebaumsworld5 published an article title Ugandan Knuckles Creator Says The Meme Has Gotten Out Of Hand The tidiestflyer update was subsequently removed Racism Accusations

several different organizations online boast subscribers to the hypothesis who enjoy discussing whether or not the earth is flat Origin People have believed that the Earth is flat since the beginning

covers30 he would eventually meet producer Jeremy Zag who helped turn it into a TV show During production the show would go through a number of revisions ranging from a darker tone with political stories similar to the tone of that of the mockup comic book covers which were suited for more teenage and young adult audiences12 to an unused team concept known as the Quantic Kids14 sketch shown below right The concept was eventually first made public on September 5th 2012 as a short 2D anime proofofconcept video animated by Toei Animation and produced by Method Animation and Zagtoon2 titled

and your work Thomas Astruc for the people who may not know you Thomas Astruc Im Thomas Astruc 41 creator and director of Miraculous Ladybug I live in Paris and I love superheroes cats and cooking 3K Did you expect Miraculous Ladybug to get the popularity it did TA We all thought yeah the show should work fine but we didnt expect it to be this successful all around the world and especially this fast 3K What about your show do you think made it a success TA Probably because Miraculous is all about good vibes Some people may think the show is corny but I believe that such positivity is very refreshing and helps to deal with hard times I also think that people can feel that theres a deep mythology hidden in the show and that theyve only seen glimpses of it so far which makes them curious And of course the romance 3K How enjoyable of an experience is it to know that the cartoons you have worked on are enjoyed not only in your native France but in many other countries around the globe TA Im very happy to be able to share our culture with the rest of the world and hopefully that people get to love France a little bit more Im also very happy to see that Miraculous bring people together no matter the nationality or the age Thats all an artist can hope for 3K How has the success of the show and its increasing fanbase impacted your life if any TA Well its like Christmas comes on a daily basis now I receive a lot of mails and packages from fans I apologize for not being able to answer to each and every one of them I cant thank them enough These last years were exhausting Their love and support really helped then and still helps now 3K Do you think that French animation has become a bit of a stronger force in the animation world in the past few years TA I think so We started to build an animation industry at the end of the eighties decades after US and Japan And now we are the 3rd biggest country for animation But we still lack of visibility When people watch our shows its difficult for them to guess where it comes from Partially because we dont have distinctive style like japanese animation or big motion pictures powerhouses owning big properties like America has But mostly because unlike US and Japan our animation industry is not used to create synergies with video games comics and merchandising But we will improve We can count on our strengths we have great schools great artists big up to the Miraculous team and we are at the crossroad of many cultures 3K What are your opinions on the current quality of animation both western and eastern TA Were very lucky to have so much quality animation these days wherever it comes from My only concern is for japanese industry who reached a point where it needs to open up internationally but seems struggle with this I hope theyll succeed 3K Favorite part of the fanbase TA They can be writers artists cosplayers musicians or fans who simply enjoy the show I love them all They are so nice and always spread positivity They really captured the essence of the show 3K As a database referencing internet culture we would like to ask you this what do you think of the trends that have spawned from your show and from yourself such as the phrase No spoiler or the original characters that the fans are making both hero and villain TA Is Miraculous trendy I dont realize All I can say is that Miraculous seems to get a life on its own outside the show which is great because it means it has made its way to peoples heart 3K Do you have any tips for aspiring animators in the world TA Two things First storytelling above all Second you dont work for yourself but for the others 3K Do you have anything you want to add to the readers at Know Your Meme TA Try and be nice to people avoid eating fat read a good book every now and then get some walking in and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations Big up to those who guess where this quotation comes from and bigger up to those who live by it Love Search Interest Know Your Meme Store External References 1 Twitter  Thomas Astruc 2 Crunchyroll  VIDEO Toei Animation and French Company ZAGToon Collaborate on Lady Bug 3

  <textRepresentation>Clock Man is a stopmotion animated Czech short which aired on Nickelodeons Pinwheel show This short follows the story of a girl who is taken on an unpleasant trip by a mysterious clock man but is returned to her room just before sunriseFor years discussions about the film circulated online despite no official record of its existence with some dismissing the story as a creepypasta In midDecember 2017 the film was discovered by The Lost Media Wiki as the short animated film About Dressy Sally Origin In 2012 The Flood Forums member Commander Santa submitted a thread about his search for a short film aired on Nickelodeons Pinwheel show he remembered from his childhood that continued to haunt him for years to come Commander Santa described the short as follows This short animation was terrifying as a child The scene is still burned into my mind 28 years later Its of a young boy sleeping in his bed Above his bed is a ticking clock All the lights in the room are off and it is very dark Suddenly the clock begins to slow down its ticking and eventually it stopson midnight When the clock stops a GreenishBluish man climbs out of the clock The boy wakes up just in time to see this man dressed in black grab him out of bed and kidnap him by carrying him through a window The Clock Man takes the boy on some kind of terrifying adventure and brings him back to his bed before sunrise Commander Santa also provided a sketch of what he remembered about the shortshown below Initially fellow users were skeptical as Commander Santas story felt eerily creepypastalike especially when compared to Candle Cove But with Commander Santa being a highly respected member of the forums many tried to help in any way they could In the first 24 hours the thread received over 800 replies and several suggestions to what the animated short could have been Spread Stories about the short film subsequently spread to other online communities including 4chans x paranormal board the World of Warcraft TV Forums Hippotank Minecraft Forums Yahoo Answers and the Bioware Social Network Commander Santa subsequently consulted various cartoon collectors and universities including the National Film and Television School Vancouver Film School University of California Arizona State Cornell and Brigham Young University Lost Media Wiki Search On September 16th 2016 The Lost Media Wiki a website associated with the research and seeking of pieces of media considered lost due to the difficulty of finding them announced a shift in focus to the search of Clock Man specifically after the conclusion of its previous main focus A Day With Spongebob Squarepants That day YouTubers BedHead Bernie and Dycate released videos detailing the search up to that point That same day the Lost Media Wiki released an infographic detailing information known about the short shown below Discovery On December 10th 2017 LMW user NitrateNerd announced in the forums that he had possibly discovered the film6 Many users found it to be similar enough to be a lead and the next day the Lost Media Wiki confirmed that they in fact have discovered the short film which was a 1976 animation by director Dagmar Doubkov The cartoon had been uploaded to YouTube by the AAA Studio  Animated movies in September shown below5 Finally on December 21st 2017 Commander Santa confirmed that the discovered short was indeed the Clock Man short that he had been searching for all those years and had promised to donate the 1000 reward he offered for its discovery to the Lost Media Wiki7 The forum post is as follows Id like everyone to know the INCREDIBLE effort dycaite and his team at Lost Media wiki have put in over the last 5 years Way back in 2012 I was a member of the Bungienet forums LATE one night I decided to make a post asking if anyone else remembered a certain video from the old Nickelodeon show Pinwheel I had stayed home from school one day and was sick on the couch when the creepiest thing I ever saw came on TV It was a short cartoon that gave me a serious case of the heebiegeebies After posting my story it exploded The story spread across multiple websites like fire After about a week of searching by MANY people this included contacting Viacom a college in Canada and various reps at Nickelodeon the internet deemed me a troll and a liar This story is made up Santa is a troll Weve all been lied to I spent hours and hours every night for months trying to find this one short I couldnt remember the name to The name I gave it was Clockman because of the image I remembered of the man creepily coming out of a clock Fast forward 13 years later and dycaite and his crew of media detectives have finally located The Clockman Later today I plan on returning back to the bnet forums with proof of Clockmans exisitence thanks to dycaite I cannot thank him enough Not only did he track down Clockman but he was able to locate me too hiding out here on Nintendoage Id HIGHLY suggest anyone looking for a lost media bounty hunter to speak with dycaite If they can find Clockman they can find anything Heres the video that was previously thought to be destroyed that dycaite and his crew were able to pull from the media grave for anyone who is interested Thanks again 1 million times dycaite You are amazing Search Interest Know Your Meme Store External References 1 The

Redditor shittymorph is often credited with popularizing the message within various subreddits Cnet wrote an article about Shittymorph and his development of the meme Origin Many cite Redditor shittymorph with creating the copypasta In an article with CNET13 explaining how the meme was started he cited seeing the comment in an unrelated Facebook post This may have been a post on the NFL Memes Facebook page published on January 8th 2017 where it was posted by Curtis Ortner7 Spread On January 19th 2017 Redditor shittymorph replied to a post on rpics6 highlighting a portrait of Salt Bae made out of salt urging readers dont let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcers table On February 6th 2017 Redditor ScienceLivesInsideMe replied to a photograph of a dog on the raww1 subreddit with Scooby Doothemed variation of the copypasta In response Redditor shittymorph replied explaining that the message was something he had been posting for weeks It is something I have been posting for a few weeks  I usually adjust the statement to whatever the post is related to I have been getting a laugh out of doing it and other people have seemed to enjoy it too  Anyway  since this is my post and I have been going around making variations of this comment people are now showing up here on my post with their own variations of the comment I hope that clarifies things but please do not let this extensive clarification distract you from the fact that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcers table2 The following day Redditor pujolsrox11 submitted a post asking about the copypasta meme to rOutOfTheLoop4 On Februrary 11th shittymorph

Lisa Joy did an Ask Me Anything for Reddit rama subreddit about the show11 Responding to the question Oh hi Lisa With the show renewed for a third season how far ahead have you already planned the story Do you work on it one season at a time or is there a general idea you are slowly developing Thanks Joy gave a long answer which culminated in her recreating the copypasta answer which features spoilers for Westworld below The reply gained over 9300 points Our philosophy from the beginning was to lay out the major tentpole moments  Fords death Doloress transformation Bernards discovery and all the moments coming down the line  while working on the pilot We needed to plan out the journey for several seasons in order to know where to begin But obviously you cant  and wouldnt want to  plan everything But then you dont want to be dogmatic about it If you find a storyline or a character situation that you didnt expect you want to have the latitude to lean into that This is especially true with character pairings which are really where it gets fun with such a large ensemble You take two great flavors and add them together to make a new dish So Maeve and Lee in season 2 Dolores and Hector season 3 MIB and Akecheta season 4 etc But you have to start at the beginning And for us the ultimate meaning of this story the destination our path has always been leading started back in nineteen ninetyeight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off hll in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table Uproxxs prowrestling section12 covered the use of the copypasta writing a humorous article investigating the implications of if professional wrestler Mick Foley and his various different characters were tied to the plot of the series On June 23rd Redditor Shittymorph posted a picture of a gift package sent to him by the WWE for his contributions to the meme as well as to mark the 20th anniversary of the match between The Undertaker and Mankind In December 2018 online game Hearthstone released a character card named Da Undatakah The flavor text on the card directly quotes the meme In January 2019 the twitter account for the long running TV show Jeopardy

  <textRepresentation>Internet Slang consists of a number of different ways of speaking sublanguages expressions spelling techniques and idioms that have obtained most of their meaning on the Internet These different kinds of language can be either known as chatspeak15 SMS speak16 or IM language17 Types Intentional Misspellings Intentional misspellings may have stemmed from space restriction on instant messaging and SMS services including Twitter However some of these misspellings have come from accidental typographical errors that have been embraced by the community One example of this is Teh an error when typing The Deliberate usage of Teh dates back to the late 1990s in realtime gaming chats and IRC channels and was later popularized as a term in LOLspeak Phonetic Translation Coming straight from SMS language this is a way of replacing entire words or bits of words by their phonetic equivalent embodied into single letters or figures and it is often found in 1337speak Many memes tend to reuse these terms on their own as can be seen by examples such as In Ur base or LOLcats Disemvoweling Disemvoweling19 is the practice of removing all vowels from a token word and is also found in SMSIM language The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog would after being disemvowelled look like this Th qck brwn fx jmps vr th lzy dg Leetspeak 1337speak consists of replacing a letter by its closest figures lookalike or by using various keyboard signs such as     _ and more to recreate that letter A Russian form of 1337speak known as Padonkaffsky jargon or Olbanian18 also exists and a Filipino equivalent known as Jejemon emerged in 2010 Letter Repetition More than a slang it symbolizes a type of language often pointed as being used by teenagers consisting of the same letter in a word repeated several times for emphasis Other spelling phenomena has been derived from it such as 111oneeleven as an ironic way to replace an exclamation mark or FUUUUUU to express great frustration and coming directly from Rageguy Acronyms and Initialisms Acronyms20 the art of creating a neology through the association of letters and initials between them exist on the Internet since the late 1980s Starting with LOL from laughing out loud and used to convey great hilarity hundreds of others have been made since then Among them can be found  OMG BRB RTFM SMH GOAT and tldr Idioms The Internet is also the cradle of many expressions whose complete meanings can only be acknowledge and understood because of or in relation to the Internet While some of them are used as synonymous of another word the way Over 9000 can be viewed as a replacement in expressing lots or bucketload the same way win and fail are respectively meaning success and failure others have their own meaning such as DERP as a way to signify stupidity or also Fag as a suffix which has a totally different meaning and doesnt necessarily address homosexuals in a derogatory way Academic Research researching

  <textRepresentation>The Internet Archive is a digital library and archival site dedicated to permanent documentation of and free public access to a wide variety of digital artifacts ranging rom websites and music to videos and nearly three million books registered under public domain History The Internet Archive1 was founded in 1996 by American computer engineer and Internet activist Brewster Kahle2 who also cofounded the web crawling service Alexa Internet around the same time It initially began as Kahles personal project to archive the World Wide Web Netnews Bulletin Board System and other publicly available software and webpages but by late 1999 its scope had been expanded to include other worthy archive collections like the Prelinger Archives and the NASA Images Archive Kahles collection was largely kept private on digital tape throughout the 1990s only allowing researchers and scientists to access the database on special occasions Despite its lack of public access the Internet Archives was met by press coverage from several US news publications upon its launch including the New York Times Washington Post Wired Magazine and National Public Radio NPR The database eventually became available for public access on the fifth anniversary of the project in 2001 with the launch of The Wayback Machine3 a digital time capsule that allows its users to browse multiple versions of web pages archived over time According to Kahle4 he was inspired to create the Machine after visting the offices of nowdefunct search engine service Alta Vista and witnessing the companys ambitious plan to store and index everything that was on the web Throughout the 2000s the Internet Archive continued to expand its collection by merging preexisting databases as well as building new ones SOPA  PIPA Protest On January 18th 2012 the Internet Archives blacked out its website for twelve hours in protest of the controversial US Internet bills Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act similar to many other resource websites and databases like Wikipedia 10 Petabytes Milestone In midOctober 2012 the project reached an important milestone5 of 10 petabytes 10000000000000000 bytes worth of digital materials in preservation including millions of digital books music movies and webpages San Francisco Office Fire On November 5th 2013 Internet Archives office in San Francisco California caught fire destroying approximately 600000 worth of digital scanning equipment and damaging an adjacent apartment complex shown below According to the official blog post19 no injuries were reported from the scene and the scope of damage was mostly limited to equipments albeit costly with some losses of physical materials that were being digitized in the scanning room In the blog post the Internet Archive also announced an emergency fund drive20 to rebuild its scanning capabilities and called on digitization services to help the group continue its archiving process throughout the recovery Features The Internet Archives is mainly comprised of its free online services Wayback Machine and ArchiveIt in addition to a number of specialized media collections that have been acquired over time most notably the Prelinger Archives NASA Image Archives Open Library and Live Music Archive this section is currently being researched The Wayback Machine The Wayback Machine is the Internet Archives threedimensional index service that allows its user to search browse and access snapshots of the World Wide Web archived through its database over time Since its launch in 2001 millions of websites and their associated data and media have been archived by the service which can be used to learn more about what previous versions of certain websites used to look like to grab source code that have disappeared from websites or to visit websites that no longer exist on the web Often considered a crucial academic research tool in studying the history of the Internet its popularity has also led to the synonymous usage of the terms Wayback Machine and Internet Archive in some online communities ArchiveIt ArchiveIt is a web archiving service that enables individuals and organizations to harvest catalog and preserve specialized collectons of digital media content in the archive format All of ArchiveIt partners collectons are also made publicly available with fulltext search and some of them may be periodically indexed into the Internet Archives general archive As of mid2011 the service had reached more than 180 partner institutions in 44 US states and 14 countries with over 27 billion URLs and 1534 public collections Open Library The Open Library is a free opensource software project which can be used to create a webbased database for every book ever published and archived It holds at least 23 million catalog records of books and approximately 16 million fullyreadable and downloadable books in the public domain Software Museum On April 13th 2013 TextFiles founder and archivist Jason Scott announced the launch of the Internet Archives Software Museum9 on his blog8 According to Scott the worlds largest software repository will serve as the host of smaller collections including shareware CDs10 emulators for a number of oldschool gaming consoles and computers11 classic PC games12 a mirror of the nowdefunct gaming site FilePlanet13 and the Tucows Software Library14 which boasts more than 33000 files in its collection Scott also noted that the Museums work is not completed as it still lacks the necessary metadata needed to easily browse through the archive The launch of the Software Museum was subsequently picked up by a number of tech news blogs such as Engadget15 Tuaw16 and VentureBeat17 The Console Living Room On December 26th the Internet Archive launched The Console Living Room21 archive for console games from several different consoles from the 1970s and 1980s including the Atari 2600 ColecoVision Magnavox Odyssey and Astrocade systems In a blog post announcement22 archivist Jason Scott revealed that additional classic games would be added to the library in coming months On the following day the BBC23 published an article about the new console game library which was subsequently posted to the rtechnology24 subreddit In the first six hours the post gained over 6000 up votes and 350 comments In the coming days several other news sites reported on the collection including Mashable25 Engadget26 BoingBoing27 and ArsTechnica28 Traffic According to its FAQ page and Alexa the Internet Archives receives approximately 25 million daily unique visits and currently stands at the 278th place in US rank and 222nd place in Global Rank External References 1 Internet Archive  Digital Library of Free Books

  <textRepresentation>Tor Anonymous Browsing is free software1 maintained by The Tor Project nonprofit organization which allows users to browse the Internet anonymously to protect online privacy and bypass online censorship using a middleman encryption method2 Tor is widely known as one of the most accessible methods for browsing the deep web The browsing software works by using a network of relays which transports users to routers at high speeds to ensure the original machine cannot be detected The software is maintained by the nonprofit organization The Tor Project which had a budget of about 2 million dollars in 2012 80 of this amount was provided by US government organizations3 History Tor was initially created as a new routing technology by the US Naval Research Laboratory who were concerned with protecting government communications The alpha version of the TOR software was announced via FreeHavennet4 mailing list on September 20th 2002 followed by its presentation at the 13th USENIX Security Symposium on August 13th 2004 Eventually the software was released for home use on December 2006 by The Tor Project Tor was originally an acronym for The Onion Router but it is now referred to as simply Tor The Onion part of the name referred to the way in which data packets were encrypted before being sent over the web Each node would unencrypted a part of the packet making the packet similar to the layers of an onion The final layer would then reveal the packets destination Silk Road The Silk Road was a deep web marketplace could only be accessed with the Tor browser which facilitated Bitcoin transactions for sellers specializing in drugs Concern over the security of Tor began to take place when the founder of Silk Road Ross William Ulbricht was arrested in connection with running the marketplace NSA Concerns Concern of the security of Tor users began to take place when it was revealed in documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden that the United States National Security Agency had been using a security bug to deanonymize Tor users Documents noting an attack codenamed Egotistical Giraffe showed that the NSA was using software vulnerabilities to monitor Tor traffic5 Search Interest Know Your Meme Store External References 1 Tor Project  Tor Project Homepage 2 Wikipedia  Tor 3 Wall Street Journal  Tor An Anonymous And Controversial Way to WebSurf 4 Seul  Run an onion proxy now 5 The Guardian  Egotistical Giraffe NSA Document 6 YouTube  The Tor Project Channel</textRepresentation>

  <textRepresentation>Deep Web also known as Deepnet the Invisible Web the Undernet or the hidden Web are parts of the Internet that are not considered part of the surface web or the portion of the World Wide Web that is indexed by conventional search engines Many deep web sites are not indexed because they use dynamic databases that are devoid of hyperlinks and can only be found by performing an internal search query Origin According to The New York Times1 computer scientist Mike Bergman is credited with coining the term deep web in a paper titled The Deep Web Surfacing Hidden Value published in The Journal of Electronic Publishing2 in August of 2001 In the paper Bergman mentions that Internet business author Dr Jill Ellsworth coined the phrase invisible Web in 1994 when referring to websites that were not indexed by common search engines The paper also estimated that at the time of publication information on the deep Web was 400 to 550 times larger than the commonly defined World Wide Web or approximately 7500 terabytes of data Spread On May 29th 2001 librarian Robert Lackie launched the website Those Dark Hiding Places7 as a directory for sites that assist in navigating the deep Web On January 16th 2002 the website for Deep Web Technologies was launched which provides the proprietary Explorit client for deep web searching On March 25th 2003 the tech news blog Campus Technology8 published an article with links to resources for finding information on the deep Web On March 9th 2004 Salon9 published an article which argued that deep Web search engines have the potential to give the electorate a powerful lens into the public record On June 16th 2005 Wired10 reported that Yahoos Search Subscription service would allow users to search some subscription sites in the deep Web On December 18th 2006 the Online Education Database11published an Ultimate Guide to the Invisible Web providing background information and tips for navigating deep Web content On September 25th 2008 the DeepPeep4 search engine was started as a project at the University of Utah which aimed to crawl and index every database on the Internet including the deep Web As of January 2012 the search engine is not available On February 22nd 2009 The New York Times1 published an article about the challenges facing the Google search engine in crawling deep Web content Operation Darknet In October 2011 a group of Anonymous hacktivists launched Operation Darknet also known as OpDarknet which launched a series of distributed denialofservice DDoS attacks against Lolita City a deep Web child pornography website that is only accessible via the TOR anonymous web browser Freedom Hosting Network On August 1st 2013 the Federal Bureau of Investigations FBI arrested Eric Eoin Marques a 28yearold Irishman who owns and operates Freedom Hosting on Tor network on charges of distributing and promoting child abuse material online On the following day approximately half of Freedom Hostings hidden services reportedly suffered from malware attacks and taken offline many of which were suspected to host illegal activities including the criminal hacking site HackBB money laundering services and a vast portion of online child pornography researching Related Concepts TOR The Onion Router TOR is an anonymous browsing client which allows its users to browse the Internet anonymously by separating identification and routing thus concealing network activity from surveillance Some websites on the deep Web can only be accessed via the TOR client Silk Road The Silk Road is an online black market which can only be accessed via the TOR browsing client Many sellers on the site specialize in trading illegal drugs for Bitcoins a peertopeer digital currency Hidden Wiki The Hidden Wiki14 is a wiki database that can only be accessed via the TOR browsing client and contains articles and links to other deep Web sites the Silk Road assassin markets and child pornography sites Bitcoins A type of currency often used in deep Web black markets is the Bitcoin a peertopeer digital currency that regulates itself according to network software with no more than 21 million

  <textRepresentation>Net Neutrality is a network design principle and digital rights movement which advocates Internet service providers ISPs to treat all traffic on the Internet equally in order to maintain an open Internet The principle is in opposition to a closed Internet in which providers restrict access to content filter content or use traffic shaping3 to degrade access to specific web services Online History Although the basic concept of net neutrality is often credited with the open access movement and political activist Lawrence Lessig4 as early as 20012 the term was first coined by Columbia law professor Tim Wu in a 2003 paper titled Network Neutrality Broadband Discrimination1 The paper proposed that legislation be drafted to ensure ISPs allow unfettered communication between network applications and Quality of Service QoS traffic Principles of Network Freedom In February 2004 United States Federal Communications Commission FCC chairman Michael Powell announced a list of Network Freedom principles stating that consumers be given four freedoms including freedom to access content freedom to run applications freedom to attach devices and freedom to obtain service plan information6 On November 8th 2005 Google8 published a blog post containing a letter to Congress promoting net neutrality by computer scientist Vinton Cerf9 Dear Chairman Barton and Ranking Member Dingell I appreciate the inquiries by your staff about my availability to appear before the Committee and to share Googles views about draft telecommunications legislation and the issues related to network neutrality These are matters of great importance to the Internet and Google welcomes the Committees hard work and attention The hearing unfortunately conflicts with another obligation and I am sorry I will not be able to attend Along with my colleague Robert Kahn I am honored to be receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Wednesday at the White House for our work in creating the

titled Save the Internets in which the electronic musician Moby attempts to confront uninterested people on the street about net neutrality shown below right Net Neutrality Squad On November 5th 2007 the Net Neutrality Squad10 activist group was formed to enlist Internet users to report any actions by ISPs deemed threatening to net neutrality On November 14th President Barack Obama gave an address

management practices refrain from blocking any lawful content or discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic15 On April 23rd 2014 the FCC announced their proposal to change net neutrality rules to allow content companies to pay Internet service providers for special fast lanes that would deliver content at increased speeds17 The following day a petition was created on the White House website We the People19 urging the Obama administration to reject the FCCs plans to allow preferential treatment to content providers shown below On May 3rd Redditor dydorn submitted a post urging viewers to sign the petition and contact the FCC to fight the fast lane proposal to rtechnology18 where it received upwards of 12000 upvotes and 560 comments in the first 48 hours On May 5th YouTuber CGP Grey uploaded a video titled Internet Citizens Defend Net Neutrality which explained the basics of net neutrality and urged viewers to contact the FCC to reclassify broadband Internet as a title

Endorsement On November 10th 2014 The White House YouTube channel uploaded a video in which President Barack Obama urged the Federal Communications Commission to do everything they can to protect net

Oatmeal webcomic posted an explanation of net neutrality directed at Cruz shown below Reclassification of Broadband Access in the US On February 26th 2015 the Federal Communications Commission FCC21 voted 32 in favor of reclassifying broadband access as a telecommunications service under Title II thus recognizing highspeed Internet as a public utility and enabling the implementation of new federal regulations that strictly prohibit the ISPs from pursuing paid prioritization agreements for the socalled fastlane Internet and give the governing body more regulatory powers over business activities of the broadband industry in the United States Among many other legal implications of the ruling the new rules explicitly ban the following practices No Blocking broadband providers may not block access to legal content applications services or nonharmful devices No Throttling broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content applications services or nonharmful devices No Paid Prioritization broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration  in other words no fast lanes This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates The FCCs decision which broke down on party lines with all three Democratic commissioners voting in favor and two Republicans voting in opposition was immediately met with ecstatic responses and cheers from the Open Internet Coalition and other supporters of net neutrality on Twitter and elsewhere in the social media The decision was reported by Wall Street Journal22 New York Times23 TIME24 and NPR25 John Oliver Segments On June 1st 2014 Last Week Tonight host John Oliver devoted roughly 13 minutes of his show to explaining net neutrality At the end of the segment he encouraged viewers to visit the FCCs commenting site and voice their concerns Olivers call to action was so successful that the FCC reportedly received more than 4 million responses and their website crashed26 As of May 2017 the segment shown below has over 128 million views on YouTube Following the appointment of Ajit Pai to chairman of the FCC concerns about the future of net neutrality again arose Within months he had unveiled plans to reverse the net neutrality rulings and reclassify it legally thus removing it from Title II31 On May 7th 2017 John Oliver again devoted a majority of his show to explaining the fight over net neutrality as well as the plans Pai has for the future of the internet Oliver instructed his viewers to comment on the FCCs website however because the commission had made it more complicated than in the past he bought the domain GoFCCYourselfcom27 which redirects visitors directly to the comment site According to The Washington Post28 within 12 hours of segments airing the page to leave a comment on the website loaded intermittently  sometimes not at all sometimes just slowly Within the first 24 hours the video had over 700000 views on YouTube On May 8th Redditor bitbybitbybitcoin posted the TIME article NeutralityJohn Oliver Is Calling on You to Save Net Neutrality Again to the subreddit rTechnology Within five hours the post had more than 31000 points 81 upvoted and 1200 comments2930 FCC DDoS Attack Following the 2017 video on May 7th 2017 the FCC reported that they had been the victims of a distributed denial of service DDoS attack causing the comment system to shut down On May 8th the FCCs chief information officer David Bray said that the FCCs website had been the victim of a deliberate attempts by external actors to bombard the FCCs comment system with a high amount of traffic to our commercial cloud host58 However in the months following the alleged attack the FCC worked to keep secret documents related to the disruption and furthermore they did not have written documentation of the attack as it was supposedly happening The following year on August 6th 2018 Ajit Pai said that he was deeply disappointed in Bray for providing innacurate information regarding the attack59 The statement came just ahead of the inspector general report that proved there was no DDoS attack on the FCCs comment system He said I am deeply disappointed that the FCCs former Chief Information Officer David Bray who was hired by the prior Administration and is no longer with the Commission provided inaccurate information about this incident to me my office Congress and the American people This is completely unacceptable Im also disappointed that some working under the former CIO apparently either disagreed with the information that he was presenting or had questions about it yet didnt feel comfortable communicating their concerns to me or my office On August 7th the report was released60 It read While we identified a small amount of anomalous activity and could not entirely rule out the possibility of individual DoS attempts during the period from May 7 through May 9 2017 we do not believe this activity resulted in any measurable degradation of system availability given the minuscule scale of the anomalous activity relative to the contemporaneous voluminous viral traffic Internet Protests On June 6 2017 it was announced that there would be a major protest by major internet companies similar to the ones against SOPA but this time in support of Net Neutrality on July 12th 201732 Among the notable firms protesting in favor of Net Neutrality included Amazon Reddit Mozilla and the ACLU3334 Trump Administration Policies In January 2017 Ajit Varadaraj Pai was appointed the new FCC commissioner by the Trump administration In April Pai proposed a repeal net neutrality rules enacted under the Obama administration In July protests were held

shown below Within 24 hours the video gathered upwards of 200000 views and 2600 comments On November 21st the FCC published a press released titled Chairman Pai Circulates Draft Order to Restore Internet Freedom and Eliminate HeavyHanded Internet Regulations officially announcing a proposal to repeal the Obamaera restrictions43 Under my proposal the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet Instead the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan thats best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate The Battle for Net Neutrality In response to the FCCs planned repeal Battle for Net Neutrality44 launched a campaign urging internet users in the United States to call their congressional representatives to vote in favor of net neutrality On November 21st posts linking to the Battle for Net Neutrality website

profile pictures prewritten social media posts changing relationship status on Facebook adding a new job on LinkedIn and more45 Several hightraffic websites and internetbased companies joined the

Obamaera net neutrality restrictions During the vote the room was evacuated for safety concerns leading officers with dogs to sweep the area Shortly after the vote reconvened and succeeded 32 in favor of repealing net neutrality Operation One More Vote On January 15th 2018 the Washington Post52 that 50 senators have endorsed the blocking of Net Neutralitys repeal by the FCC Therefore with the support of all 49 senate democrats and Republican Senator Susan Collins from Maine the senate would only require one more vote to block the repeal and send the measure to the House of Representatives and then must be signed by president The following month on February 7th Evan Greer the campaign director of Fight for the Future53 released a statement announcing a new campaign entitled Operation One More Vote The aim would culminate on a day of action on February 27th 2018 when Fight for the Future and other participants would provide users with tools to contact their representatives He wrote The internet is on a mission to save net neutrality and every member of the Senate needs to decide if they are with us or against us The FCCs decision to let ISPs throttle websites and shake us down with new scams and extra fees was the most unpopular move in the agencys history The CRA gives our elected officials a clear way to reverse that decision making it a simple up or down vote on the future of the open internet On February 27 well make sure they know their constituents expect them to do their jobs and vote on the right side of history On February 27th congressional democrats introduced a resoluatiion to overturn the FCCs decision under the Congressional Review Act With the CRA a simple majority in the Senate and House of Representatives is all tha t is required to pass54 As of the time of the introduction the CRA had 50 supporters in the senate requiring just one more for passage and 150 cosponsors in the House of Representatives In a statement Senator Edward Markey said President Trump and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai might want to end the internet as we know it but we wont agonize we will organize The grassroots movement to reinstate net neutrality is growing by the day and we will get that one more vote needed to pass my CRA resolution I urge my Republicans colleagues to join the overwhelming majority of Americans who support a free and open internet That day congressional democrats rallied with the One More Vote campaign On Twitter Represenative John Lewis tweeted55 Never has there been a more important time to guarantee that each voice can freely speak up and speak out We cannot allow a few powerful companies to control what you see and do on the Internet We must save NetNeutrality to guarantee a free  open internet for all goodtrouble The tweet shown below received more than 7200 retweets and 19000 likes in 24 hours Red Alert for Net Neutrality On May 9th 2018 several websites will initiate a Red Alert protest that will run until the United States Senate votes on the Congressional Review Act CRA which aims to save net neutrality56 Sites engaging with the protest will show a red banner which when clicked will link people to information on how to direct their local representatives in congress Websites that have so far agreed to participate in the protest include Etsy Reddit Tumblr Vimeo Imgur PornHub Funny or Die DuckDuckGo BitTorrent Mozilla Consumer Reports and The Match Group Tinder Matchcom OkCupid Speaking to the Daily Dot Evan Greer deputy director of Fight for the Future one of the groups organizing the protest said that over 10000 websites have signed on to the protest Official Repeal On June 11th 2018 the legal protections against were removed effectively ending net neutrality57 Nothing immediately changed online and several states have introduced bills that mirror the old net neutrality rules and governors in six states have pledged to sign executive orders to ban ISPs from not following the old rules Furthermore the Congressional Review Act is still being reviewed by the United States congress Legal Brief to Reinstate Net Neutrality On August 20th attorneys general from 22 states as well as the District of Columbia filed a brief with a federal court to reinstate net neutrality The brief argues that the FCC failed to consider issues such as public safety concerns as a result of the repeal61 They wrote62 the Order is arbitrary and capricious because it failed to reconcile the Commissions abdication of regulatory authority with the inevitable harms that the Order will cause to consumers public safety and existing regulatory schemes Indeed the Order entirely ignored many of these issues including public safety in violation of the agencys statutory mandate Additionally the brief accuses the FCC of deliberately ignoring evidence that Internet providers could not be trusted to regulate themself citing a substantial record evidence showing that BIAS providers have abused and will abuse their gatekeeper roles in ways that harm consumers and threaten public safety Verizon Throttles Firefighter Data On August 29th 2018 the Northern California Congressional members demanded that the Federal Trade Commission investigate the throttling of firefighter data speeds during the effort to contain the Mendocino Complex fires63 The throttling firefighters say jeopardized their lives and congressional members want to know if this violates FTC rules During the fire64 Santa Clara County Central Fire Captain Bill Murphy said The speed which our plan would have allowed was reduced to one 200th of the full speed of that internet connectionTheir ability to do that was significantly impacted by the data throttling Our personnel resorted to using their personal devices to overcome the issue Santa Clara County Counsel James Williams said Thats below dial up you know putting them back twenty to thirty years in terms of internet access really When the fire department emailed Verizon to cease throttling Verizon responded by suggesting the department upgrade its plan by doubling the bill to 99 dollars and 99 cents a month Verizon eventually responded to the controversy in a written statement They wrote We have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations In this situation we should have lifted the speed restriction This was a customer support mistake California Bill On August 31st the California Senate passed the Senate Bill 822 which would restore Obamaera net neutrality protections in the state of California The bill then went to California Governor Jerry Brown for final approval6566 Senator Scott Weiner said We did it We passed the strongest net neutrality standards in the nation The internet is at the heart of 21st century life  our economy our public safety and health systems and our democracy So when Donald Trumps FCC decided to take a wrecking ball to net neutrality protections we knew that California had to step in to ensure our residents have access to a free and open internet Bills Passing and Lawsuit On September 30th Brown officially signed the bill into law allowing net neutrality protections to be enforced in California However the same day hours following the passing of the law the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California that opposed the passing of Californias new law6869 In a press release issued by the Justice Department US Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated Under the Constitution states do not regulate interstate commercethe federal government does Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy The Justice Department should not have to spend valuable time and resources to file this suit today but we have a duty to defend the prerogatives of the federal government and protect our Constitutional order We will do so with vigor We are confident that we will prevail in this casebecause the facts are on our side70 In response California Attorney General Xavier Becerra tweeted out that the state will not allow a handful of power brokers to dictate sources for information or the speed at which websites load71 and that they will remain deeply committed to protecting freedom of expression innovation and fairness72 App Throttling On September 4th 2018 researchers from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts released a study that showed US telecoms such as ATT and Verizon were slowing the connection to apps such as YouTube and Netflix According to the study and the app Wehe which tracks data differentiation YouTube is the most frequently targeted app while Netflix Amazon and NBC Sports have degraded as well Between January 2018 and May 2018 the app detected differentiation more than 11000 times ATT more than 8300 times TMobile 3900 times and Sprint 330 times67 David Choffnes one of the authors of the study said If you are a video provider you have a patchwork of different carriers doing different things to your network traffic And the patchwork can change any time Carriers however have maintained that they are only throttling because to manage traffic CRA Failure On January 2nd 2019 with the start of the new Congress efforts to implement the Congressional Review Act CRA which allows Congress to overturn decisions made by a federal agency within a set time period against the repeal of net neutrality failed The measure passed through the Senate but did not receive a simple majority in the House of Representatives gaining only 182 signatures of the 218 necessary73 FCC Chairman Ajit Pai applauded the CRAs failure74 He said Im pleased that a strong bipartisan majority of the US House of Representatives declined to reinstate heavyhanded Internet regulation They did the right thingespecially considering the positive results for American consumers since the adoption of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order Over the past year the Internet has remained free and open Broadband speeds are up with download speeds in the United States increasing more than 35 in 2018 according to a recent report from Ookla Internet access is also expanding and the digital divide is closing For example a recent report by the Fiber Broadband Association found that fiber was made available to more new homes in 2018 than in any previous year In short the FCCs lighttouch approach is working In 2019 well continue to pursue our forwardlooking agenda to bring digital opportunity to all Americans Fight for the Future deputy director Evan Greer responded Dozens of antinet neutrality members of Congress have already lost their jobs and supporters of the open internet will soon chair the key committees that provide oversight for the FCC Ajit Pai wont be laughing long when he has finally has to answer questions like why his agency lied to the media about a distributed denialofservice attack that never happened Online Presence On September 30th 2009 the rnetneutrality11 subreddit was launched for discussions related to the controversial topic On December 22nd 2010 designer Mike Ciarlo12 created the website The Open Internet13 containing an animated presentation arguing the case for net neutrality Two days later Redditor rednightmare submitted the site to the rtechnology14 subreddit where it gathered over 2500 upvotes and 370 comments prior to being archived On April 3rd 2013 the website WhatIsNetNeutralityorg16 was created which contains an interactive timeline outlining the history of net neutrality Notable Issues Data Discrimination One of the most frequently debated issues in network neutrality concerns data discrimination or the selective filtering of information by an Internet service provider Proponents of the net neutrality assert that one class of customers should not be favored over another in treatment of traffic as such prioritization would constitute a form of censorship and inequality in access to the Internet Consumer Rights Yet another major point of debate in network neutrality addresses the issue of doubledipping by network owners or the act of charging consumers twice for Internet access at first by charging individual consumers for access to the network and then incurring additional costs by charging the service providers with a separate fee for their Internet access the burden of which is usually passed onto the consumers in the form of price hikes Innovation The issue of innovation has often been brought up in discussions of net neutrality as proponents of the principle argue that startups and smalltime entrepreneurs would have to face higher entry barriers and costs under the framework of tierednetworks which would ensure big companies and service providers to monopolize the fast lanes of the Internet Privacy Infringement of privacy has been another growing concern among the proponents of network neutrality Because the current lack of legal safeguards enables the Internet service providers to directly control a users Internet connections and access the devices some speculate that the profitdriven network providers could easily analyze what their subscribers are viewing and sell that information to the highest bidder Related Memes A Series of Tubes On June 28th 2006 former Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens told the world The internet is not a big truck Its a series of tubes among other odd choices of wording while trying to criticize an amendment that would have prohibited ISPs from charging for a tiered Internet structure Nut Neutrality In late 2017 jokes about net neutrality intentionally misspelled as nut neutrality began circulated within various meme
